# ChatterFix.ai - 90-Second Investor Pitch

**(Start with confidence, looking directly at the investors)**

"Every year, companies waste over a trillion dollars on technical debt â€” developers fixing broken code instead of building new products.

We've all felt it. The late-night bug hunts. The production rollbacks. The soul-crushing work of fixing the same dumb errors, over and over again.

This isn't a tooling problem. It's an intelligence problem.

My name is Fred, and we've built the solution.

We've created **ChatterFix**, the world's first AI-powered maintenance platform that acts as a full-time, autonomous developer on your team.

Our system doesn't just *find* errors; it *fixes* them. It runs on every commit, automatically repairing bugs, style issues, and syntax errors. It then runs the test suite to *prove* that its fixes work, and it logs every action in a permanent, auditable Dev Journal.

We've built a system that doesn't just assist developers; it makes them faster, smarter, and more focused.

We are raising a seed round of $1 million to scale our platform, expand our AI's capabilities, and onboard our first 100 enterprise clients.

Stop paying your developers to be janitors. Let them be architects.

Let's build the future of software development, together."
