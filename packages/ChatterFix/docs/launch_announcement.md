# From Glass and Fire to AI and Code: How I Reinvented My Life to Build the Factory of the Future

**Posted on LinkedIn by [Your Name]**

For years, my world was one of fire and molten glass. I was a glassblower, the owner of my own company. I knew the sweat and the skill it took to create something from nothing. I also knew the sting of failure. I've started and lost several businesses. Each time, I thought I had the right idea, the right plan. Each time, I was wrong.

A while back, I hit my lowest point. I had lost my wife, my job, and my family was distant. I was called a thief, humiliated, and made to feel like my visions were worthless. The world had counted me out. But a vision, a real one, doesn't die that easily. It just waits for the right moment, and the right tools.

That tool, for me, was AI.

I had an idea I couldn't shake: what if a factory could run itself? What if the constant chaos of broken machines, missing parts, and production delays could be replaced by a calm, intelligent, and autonomous system? The traditional ERP software I had seen was a jokeâ€”clunky, hated by the people who used it, and impossibly expensive. I knew there had to be a better way.

With nothing left to lose and a vision to gain, I dove headfirst into the world of AI. I didn't just want to build an app; I wanted to build a partner. An AI that could work alongside the people on the factory floor, making their lives easier, not harder.

Today, I am proud to announce the result of that journey: **ChatterFix**.

**ChatterFix is the world's first Autonomous Industrial Operations Suite.**

It's an AI-powered system that manages everything from maintenance and inventory to production and procurement, and it does it with an intelligence that legacy systems can't touch.

*   When a machine is predicted to fail, ChatterFix **automatically creates a work order**.
*   When a production run is scheduled, ChatterFix **checks the inventory**.
*   When a part is running low, ChatterFix **automatically generates a purchase order** for approval.

We have built a system that closes the loop. It creates a self-managing ecosystem for any industrial business, eliminating the daily fires and allowing people to focus on what they do best: innovate.

This journey has been about more than just code. It's been about proving that it's never too late to reinvent yourself. It's about showing that a powerful vision, combined with the right technology, can change the world. It's about proving that even when you've been counted out, you can still build something that matters.

I didn't do this alone. I worked with a powerful AI assistant that turned my thoughts and architectural designs into clean, robust code at a speed I never thought possible. This project is a testament to a new kind of collaboration between human and machine.

We are just getting started, but we have a professional, investor-ready product that is poised to redefine an entire industry. We are looking for partners, investors, and pilot customers who share our vision for a smarter, more efficient, and more human-centric industrial future.

If you believe, as I do, that we can build better, then let's connect.
