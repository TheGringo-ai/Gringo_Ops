- **Natural Language Interface**: Generate and manage tools using intuitive natural language commands.
- **Full-Stack Support**: From backend APIs to frontend interfaces, GringoOps handles the entire stack.
- **Automated Deployment**: Simplify deployment with integrated scripts and cloud support.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Built-in continuous integration and delivery pipelines for rapid iteration.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Seamless deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with containerization.

## Installation and Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheGringo-ai/Gringo_Ops.git
cd Gringo_Ops
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./launch.sh
```

## Usage

Once launched, interact with GringoOps through the CLI or web interface to generate AI-powered tools by providing natural language prompts. For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the `docs/` directory.

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

Run the included `launch.sh` script to start the platform locally. Ensure all dependencies are installed as per the requirements.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Deployment

1. **Build Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t gringoops:latest .
   ```

2. **Push to Google Container Registry**

   ```bash
   docker tag gringoops:latest gcr.io/your-project-id/gringoops:latest
   docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/gringoops:latest
   ```

3. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**

   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy gringoops --image gcr.io/your-project-id/gringoops:latest --platform managed --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

GringoOps includes GitHub Actions workflows to automate testing, building, and deployment:

- **Tests**: Automated unit and integration tests run on every pull request.
- **Build**: Docker images are built and pushed upon merging to the main branch.
- **Deploy**: Automated deployment to GCP Cloud Run triggered on successful builds.

Configure your repository secrets for GCP credentials to enable seamless CI/CD.
