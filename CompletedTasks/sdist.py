The code provided appears to be a Python script related to managing source distributions and their metadata using PEP 517. It involves preparing distribution metadata, handling build isolation, and installing build dependencies.

Here are some suggestions for improvements and comments on the code:

1. Typing Improvements:
   - Type hints are used effectively throughout the code, which is good practice for readability and maintainability.
   - Ensure that the type hints are correctly defined and adhere to the actual types used in the methods.

2. Error Handling:
   - Error handling through custom exceptions (like `InstallationError`) is present and should be functional.
   - Make sure that error messages are informative and provide details about the encountered issues.

3. Code Readability:
   - The code structure is clear and follows PEP 8 guidelines, making it easier to read and understand.
   - Consider adding comments to explain complex or critical sections of the code, especially for methods like `_prepare_build_backend`.

4. Functionality:
   - The functionality related to preparing distribution metadata and checking build dependencies seems well-implemented.
   - Ensure that the methods like `_prepare_build_backend` and `_install_build_reqs` are working correctly as they play a crucial role in the process.

5. Logging:
   - Logging is used in the code (e.g., `logger.warning`). Make sure that logging levels and messages are appropriate for different scenarios.

6. Testing:
   - Verify the functionality of the code by testing different scenarios, especially around isolation, build dependencies, and error handling.

7. Package Dependencies:
   - Confirm that all dependencies required by the script are correctly imported at the beginning of the file.

If the code is part of a larger project or system, it might be beneficial to integrate it into the complete system and run end-to-end tests to ensure that it functions correctly within the ecosystem.
