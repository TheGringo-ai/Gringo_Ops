Improvement Suggestion:
1. Add type hints to the methods in the `PipDebuggingReporter` class for better clarity and consistency with the rest of the code.
2. Include default values in the method arguments of the `PipDebuggingReporter` class to avoid potential errors when calling the methods without providing all required arguments.
