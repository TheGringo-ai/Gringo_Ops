The code in the `datetime.py` file is simple and straightforward. It defines a function `today_is_later_than` that takes three arguments for year, month, and day and compares it with the current date.

Here are a few improvements that can be suggested:

1. Add type hints for the return type of the function.
2. Add some comments to explain the purpose of the function.
3. Consider handling exceptions that might occur when creating a `datetime.date` object with the given year, month, and day.

Here is the updated code with these improvements:

```python
import datetime

def today_is_later_than(year: int, month: int, day: int) -> bool:
    """Check if today's date is later than the given date."""
    try:
        today = datetime.date.today()
        given = datetime.date(year, month, day)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Invalid date provided: {e}")
        return False

    return today > given
```

If there are any specific requirements for error handling or additional functionalities needed, please provide more details.
