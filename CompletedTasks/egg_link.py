Improvements:
1. Add type hints for return types in functions.
2. Update the type hints for `sites` variable to include a List of str instead of just str.
3. Fix the typo in the variable name `egglink` to `egg_link` for consistency.
4. Add type hint for the `egg_link` variable in the loop.
5. Add type hints for the `egg_link_name` variable in the loop.
6. Add a docstring to describe the purpose of the functions.
7. Refactor the function `egg_link_path_from_sys_path` to make the code more readable.

Here is the improved code:
