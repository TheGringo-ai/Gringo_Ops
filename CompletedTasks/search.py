1. Add a task comment to the file:
# Task: Review and apply suggested improvements to the code in the 'search.py' file.

2. Review the code and apply the following improvements:

- Import statements: Rearrange import statements to group standard library imports, third-party imports, and internal imports separately for better readability.
- Type Annotations: Add type annotations to variables, function arguments, and return types where needed.
- Replace assert statement: Replace the assert statement in the search function with an explicit check and raise an exception if needed.
- Fix the highest_version function: Handle the case where the versions list is empty in the highest_version function to avoid errors.

After applying these improvements, the code will be more structured, readable, and safer.
