Improvements:
1. Add a task comment to handle the case when a cycle is detected and we break the cycle.
```python
# Handle if a cycle is detected and break the cycle
```
2. Add a task comment to handle the case when we need to simplify the graph to prune leaves without dependencies.
```python
# Simplify the graph by removing leaves without dependencies
```
