Improvements made in the code:

1. Added type hints for sequence and candidate as the code is not readable without them.
2. Added type hint for import
3. Improved the import statement
4. Updated the `Sequence` class reference to work with Python 3.8
5. Removed redundant block comment
6. Clarified the purpose of the `FoundCandidates` class in the comment
7. Updated the `__getitem__` and `__len__` methods to raise `NotImplementedError` for performance reasons
8. Added documentation to the `__iter__` method to explain why incompatible candidates are filtered out
9. Added a return statement to the `__bool__` method

The code looks cleaner and simplified after applying the improvements.
