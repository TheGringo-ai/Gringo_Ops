The code provided is a part of a Python package uninstallation script. Here are some improvements that can be applied:

1. Add docstrings to functions that are missing them. This will help other developers understand the purpose of the functions.
2. Replace the use of `os.path.sep` with `os.path.sep` for better cross-platform compatibility.
3. Add a blank line between functions to improve readability.
4. Avoid using `lru_cache` with instance methods. It should be used with static or class methods.
5. Use `os.path.normcase` consistently for case normalization of paths.
6. Some docstrings mention "RECORD" and ".py[co]" files, but these terms are not defined within the script itself. Consider adding more context or references.
7. The `UninstallPthEntries` class could benefit from more detailed comments to explain its purpose and functionality.

By addressing these points, the script will become more readable, maintainable, and compliant with best practices.
