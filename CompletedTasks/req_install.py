The code provided is written in Python and contains classes and functions for managing requirements installation in Python projects. The code is well-documented with clear comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of the different components.

Here are some suggested improvements and additional tasks to consider:

1. **Improvements:**
    - Consider changing `Values` in the function signatures to `Dict` or `Any` for more flexibility.
    - Use type hints for return types in functions to improve readability and maintainability.
    - The `check_legacy_setup_py_options` function can be made more concise by using list comprehensions or other iterable operations.

2. **Additional Tasks:**
    - Append a task comment in the file requesting clarification on the purpose or usage of the `check_invalid_constraint_type` and `_has_option` functions.
    - Ensure that the code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
    - Consider writing unit tests for the functions and classes to ensure they work as expected.
    - Add error handling and exception raising in critical areas where failures could occur.
