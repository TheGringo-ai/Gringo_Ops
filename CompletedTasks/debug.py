1. The usage of `optparse` has been deprecated as of Python 2.7 and has been replaced by `argparse`. It is recommended to update the code to use `argparse` instead of `optparse`.
2. The use of the `pip._vendor` package directly is discouraged as it is considered an internal implementation detail of pip. It would be better to avoid importing directly from this package and find alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality.
3. The use of `Values` from `optparse` is not recommended. It is better to use the `argparse` module for argument parsing.
4. The code seems to be structured as a console script, so adding a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the file to allow the script to be run directly would be beneficial.
5. The `make_target_python` function is imported from `cmdoptions` but not used. If it is necessary, it should be utilized, otherwise, it can be removed.
6. The `indent_log` function is used for logging indentation. This might be a custom utility function, so it should be reviewed to ensure it is working as intended.
7. The `logging` configuration could be improved by setting the logging level and formatting according to the requirements of the application.
8. There are no unit tests provided for the functions defined. Adding unit tests would be beneficial for verifying the correctness of the functions.
9. The code could benefit from inline comments for better readability and maintainability.
