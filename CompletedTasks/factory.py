Improvements:
1. Add documentation to the Factory class.
2. Improve the error handling in the `get_installation_error` method to provide clearer error messages.
3. Refactor the `_iter_found_candidates` method for better readability and maintainability. 

Overall, the code is structured well and has good type hinting.
