1. The code is well-structured and easy to read. 
2. The logger statements are informative and helpful for debugging.
3. The `IndexCommand` class provides a clear structure for different actions.
4. The `add_options` method is well-organized and adds necessary options.
5. The `run` method handles different actions and error logging effectively.
6. The `_build_package_finder` method creates a package finder with appropriate settings.
7. The `get_available_package_versions` method retrieves available package versions and displays them.

Improvements:
1. Add type hints and docstrings to functions for better readability and maintainability.
2. Check for any unused imports and remove them to keep the code clean.
3. Consider handling the case where no versions are found more gracefully, with additional error messages or logging.
4. Ensure that all exception types being handled are clearly documented and specific.
5. Add comments to complex logic blocks to provide clarity on the purpose of the code.
6. Implement error handling for cases where the query does not return any results.

Overall, the code structure is good, but adding more documentation and error handling would enhance its quality. If you need further assistance with specific improvements or new features, feel free to ask.
