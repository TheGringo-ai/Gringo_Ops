Improvements:
1. The code contains a class `_Prefix`, but it is not used. Either remove the class or use it in the code.
2. In the `_dedup` function, the return type is `Tuple[str]`, but the function returns `Tuple[str, str]`. Update the return type to `Tuple[str, str]`.
3. In the `_get_system_sitepackages` function, the return type is `Set[str]`, but the return value is a list. Update the return type to `Set[str]`.
4. In the `BuildEnvironment` class, the `__enter__` method should return `self`.
5. In the `BuildEnvironment` class, the `_install_requirements` method has a parameter `kind: str`, but it is not used inside the method. It can be removed if not required.
6. In the `NoOpBuildEnvironment` class, the `cleanup` method is defined but not used. If it's not intended to be used, consider removing it.
