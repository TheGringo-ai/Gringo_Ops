Improvements suggested:
1. Add docstrings to the classes and methods.
2. Add type hints for the return type of the `wrapper` function.
3. Add a try-except block around the code in the `_build_session` method to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately.
4. Add error handling when calling `temp_build_dir.path` in the `make_requirement_preparer` method to handle potential `None` values.
5. Add exception handling when calling the `install_req_from_parsed_requirement` method in the `get_requirements` method.
6. Add a comment explaining the purpose of the `warn_if_run_as_root` function.
7. Remove unnecessary import of the `partial` function from the `functools` module.
8. Consider refactoring the code to make it more readable and maintainable, such as breaking down complex methods into smaller, more modular functions.
