Improvements made to the 'show.py' file:

1. The `search_packages_info` function now uses the `dist.canonical_name` instead of `dist.raw_name` as the key for the `installed` dictionary, to maintain consistency.
2. Added type hints to the `print_results` function arguments for better code readability and type-checking.
3. Added type hints for the return type of the functions `search_packages_info` and `print_results` for better type-checking.
4. Used `sorted` function to sort the results of `sorted` and `_get_requiring_packages` functions to ensure predictable output order.
5. Improved the readability of the `print_results` function by adding meaningful comments.
6. Updated the `search_packages_info` function to handle potential exceptions when accessing the `dist.editable_project_location` attribute by checking for None value.

The code is now more structured, readable, and follows standard conventions.
