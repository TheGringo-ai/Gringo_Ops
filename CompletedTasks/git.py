The code looks well-structured and organized. Here are a few suggestions for improvements:

1. **Refactor `get_git_version` method**: Instead of using regex to parse the Git version, you can use the `subprocess` module to directly query the Git version using the `git --version` command. This would simplify the code and make it more reliable.

2. **Use f-strings for string formatting**: Wherever possible, you can use f-strings for string formatting instead of concatenation. For example, in the `resolve_revision` method, the logger.warning message can be formatted using f-strings.

3. **Improve comments**: Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each method and any complex logic. This will make the code easier to understand for other developers.

4. **Handle exceptions**: Ensure that all potential exceptions are properly handled in the code. For example, if an unexpected error occurs in the `resolve_revision` method, make sure to catch and handle it appropriately.

5. **Code readability**: Consider breaking down long lines of code into multiple lines to improve readability. For example, in the `fetch_new` method, the `make_command` call could be split into multiple lines for better readability.

Overall, the code structure and organization are good. Implementing the above suggestions would further enhance the code quality.
