Improvements:
1. Include type hints for the arguments and return type in the docstring of the `is_archive_file` function.
2. Add a more descriptive comment for the `splitext` function in the import statement.
3. Separate the `if` condition into a single line for better readability.
4. Use `in` operator with a tuple directly in the condition instead of using `splitext` in the `ext` variable.

After applying the suggested improvements, the updated filetypes.py file would look like this:

```python
# File: filetypes.py
"""Filetype information.
"""

from typing import Tuple

from pip._internal.utils.misc import splitext  # splitext: Extracts file extension from the path.

WHEEL_EXTENSION = ".whl"
BZ2_EXTENSIONS: Tuple[str, ...] = (".tar.bz2", ".tbz")
XZ_EXTENSIONS: Tuple[str, ...] = (
    ".tar.xz",
    ".txz",
    ".tlz",
    ".tar.lz",
    ".tar.lzma",
)
ZIP_EXTENSIONS: Tuple[str, ...] = (".zip", WHEEL_EXTENSION)
TAR_EXTENSIONS: Tuple[str, ...] = (".tar.gz", ".tgz", ".tar")
ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS = ZIP_EXTENSIONS + BZ2_EXTENSIONS + TAR_EXTENSIONS + XZ_EXTENSIONS


def is_archive_file(name: str) -> bool:
    """Return True if `name` is considered as an archive file.

    Args:
        name (str): The file name.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the file is considered an archive, False otherwise.
    """
    if splitext(name)[1].lower() in ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS:
        return True
    return False
```

Make sure to test the functionality after applying these improvements to ensure that everything works as expected.
