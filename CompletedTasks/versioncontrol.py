The code provided is a Python module that defines classes and functions for handling version control systems (VCS). Here's a review of the code along with some suggestions for improvements:

1. **Type Annotations**: The use of type annotations is great, and it helps in making the code more readable and maintainable.

2. **Error Handling**: The code includes custom exceptions (`RemoteNotFoundError`, `RemoteNotValidError`) for handling specific error scenarios. This is a good practice.

3. **Completeness**: The code includes some methods that are marked as `NotImplementedError`, which suggests that these methods should be implemented in subclasses. This approach is suitable for defining an abstract interface.

4. **Documentation**: The code contains docstrings for classes and methods, which is helpful for understanding the purpose and behavior of each component.

5. **Logging**: The code uses the `logging` module for logging messages, which is a good practice for providing information and debugging details.

6. **Code Organization**: The code is well-structured, with classes and functions logically organized within the module.

7. **Suggestions for Improvement**:
    - Implement the missing methods in the `VersionControl` class and its subclasses to provide complete functionality for different VCS systems.
    - Consider adding unit tests to cover the implemented functionality and ensure correctness.
    - Improve the error handling by adding more specific error messages and handling edge cases.
    - Check for code readability and maintainability by following Python coding conventions (PEP 8).
    - Consider adding more detailed comments in complex methods to explain the logic and algorithms used.

Overall, the code is a good starting point for implementing VCS support in Python applications. It provides a clear structure and extensibility for supporting various VCS systems. 

If you have any specific improvements or features you would like to add, feel free to mention them for further assistance.
