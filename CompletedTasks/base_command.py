1. Typing is used in the code to define the function argument types. This can help catch type-related errors early on during development. 
2. Add missing docstrings to the methods and classes to explain their purpose and functionality. 
3. Consider adding comments to explain the logic of complex functions to improve code readability. 
4. The `add_options` method is currently empty. If it is intended to add options, consider implementing it to define additional command-line options. 
5. The `handle_pip_version_check` method is currently a no-op. If there is a need for version checking, consider implementing this method. 
6. The `intercepts_unhandled_exc` decorator is a good approach to handle exceptions in a centralized manner. 
7. The code structure is modular and organized, which is beneficial for maintenance and readability. 
8. Consider adding more error handling for specific exceptions that might arise during execution.
