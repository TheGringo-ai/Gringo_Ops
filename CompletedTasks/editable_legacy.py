The code is well-structured and informative. I suggest adding a docstring to the `install_editable` function for better documentation:

```python
def install_editable(
    *,
    global_options: Sequence[str],
    prefix: Optional[str],
    home: Optional[str],
    use_user_site: bool,
    name: str,
    setup_py_path: str,
    isolated: bool,
    build_env: BuildEnvironment,
    unpacked_source_directory: str,
) -> None:
    """Install a package in editable mode.

    Args:
        global_options: A sequence of global options.
        prefix: Optional installation prefix.
        home: Optional installation home directory.
        use_user_site: Flag indicating user site installation.
        name: Name of the package.
        setup_py_path: Path to the setup.py file.
        isolated: Flag indicating whether the installation is isolated.
        build_env: BuildEnvironment object for the installation.
        unpacked_source_directory: Directory with the unpacked source.

    This function runs setup.py develop for the provided package.
    """
    logger.info("Running setup.py develop for %s", name)
    ...
```

This docstring will help in understanding the purpose of the function and its arguments.
