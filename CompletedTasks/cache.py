Improvement suggestions:
1. Properly format the file by adhering to PEP 8 guidelines.
2. Use argparse instead of optparse as it is deprecated.
3. Replace pip._internal.cli.base_command.Command with argparse.Action for subcommands.
4. Remove the unnecessary ignore_require_venv attribute.
5. Use the pathlib module to manipulate file paths.
6. Add docstrings to methods and classes for better code readability.
