I see that the code in `installation_report.py` is related to generating an installation report with details about the installed requirements. Here are some improvements that can be suggested:

1. Import Statements: The import statements for modules should be grouped together at the beginning of the file for better readability and maintainability.

2. Docstrings: It would be beneficial to add docstrings to classes and methods to provide information about their purpose and usage.

3. Error Handling: Add error handling for scenarios where exceptions might be raised, such as handling the case when `ireq.download_info` is `None`.

4. Variable Naming: Improve variable names to make them more descriptive and easier to understand.

5. Type Annotations: Ensure that type annotations are correctly applied to variables and return types.

6. Comment for Future Improvement: Add a comment as a task for a future improvement related to the environment markers evaluation.

Below is the updated code with the suggested improvements:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Sequence

from pip import __version__
from pip._internal.req.req_install import InstallRequirement
from pip._vendor.packaging.markers import default_environment


class InstallationReport:
    def __init__(self, install_requirements: Sequence[InstallRequirement]):
        self._install_requirements = install_requirements

    @classmethod
    def _install_req_to_dict(cls, ireq: InstallRequirement) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Convert InstallRequirement to a dictionary for reporting.
        """
        if not ireq.download_info:
            raise ValueError(f"No download_info for {ireq}")

        res = {
            "download_info": ireq.download_info.to_dict(),
            "is_direct": ireq.is_direct,
            "is_yanked": ireq.link.is_yanked if ireq.link else False,
            "requested": ireq.user_supplied,
            "metadata": ireq.get_dist().metadata_dict,
        }
        if ireq.user_supplied and ireq.extras:
            res["requested_extras"] = sorted(ireq.extras)
        return res

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Generate a dictionary representation of the installation report.
        """
        return {
            "version": "1",
            "pip_version": __version__,
            "install": [
                self._install_req_to_dict(ireq) for ireq in self._install_requirements
            ],
            "environment": default_environment(),
            # Task: Add an environment_override field for future improvements.
        }
```

Please review the suggested improvements and apply them to the `installation_report.py` file. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
