Improvements made to the file include:

1. Added missing implementation for the `SelfCheckState.key` property to ensure it returns the prefix of the key.
2. Improved the `_self_version_check_logic` function to check if the local version is older than the remote version based on the base version.
3. Updated the `pip_self_version_check` function to handle exceptions when checking the latest version of pip and log them for debugging purposes.
4. Added type hints for the `pip_self_version_check` function parameters to improve clarity.

The file now contains a more refined self-check mechanism and better logging for error handling.
