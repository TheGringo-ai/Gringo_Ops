Improvement Suggestions:
1. Add proper type hints to the `BasePath` class methods.
2. Use `raise NotImplementedError()` instead of `NotImplementedError()` in the `BasePath` class methods.
3. Consider adding more detailed type hints where applicable.
4. Add error handling for potential exceptions.
5. Improve readability by adding comments to clarify the purpose of each function or class.
