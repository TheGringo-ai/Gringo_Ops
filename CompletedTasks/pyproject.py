Improvements:
1. Add type hints to the load_pyproject_toml function.
2. Simplify the logic when determining whether to use PEP 517.
3. Remove unnecessary assert statement.
4. Add type hints for the return value of the load_pyproject_toml function.

Here are the improvements applied to the code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def load_pyproject_toml(
    use_pep517: Optional[bool], pyproject_toml: str, setup_py: str, req_name: str
) -> Optional[Tuple[List[str], str, List[str], List[str]]:
```

The load_pyproject_toml function now has type hints for its return value.
