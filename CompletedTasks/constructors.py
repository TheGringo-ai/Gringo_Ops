The file seems to be well-organized and structured. There are a few suggestions for improvements:

1. In the function `install_req_from_parsed_requirement`, consider adding a task comment to handle the case when `parsed_req.is_editable` is False for better clarity.
2. Ensure that the methods are tested thoroughly to verify their correctness and functionality.
3. Add type hints to the `parsed_req` parameter in the `install_req_from_parsed_requirement` function for consistency with other type annotations.
