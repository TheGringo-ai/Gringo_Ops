The code provided seems to be a set of functions that generate arguments for various setuptools commands. Here are some suggestions for improvements:

1. **Type Annotations**: The function signatures already use type annotations, which is great. But it would be better to use `Union` instead of `Optional` for the types that can be `None` to make it more clear.

2. **Docstrings**: Functions have docstrings, which is good. Ensure that the docstrings are detailed enough to explain the purpose of each function and its parameters.

3. **Code Styling**: The code is already well-formatted and follows PEP 8 guidelines. Continue to follow the same style throughout the codebase.

4. **Error Handling**: Add appropriate error handling in functions based on the expected scenarios. For example, handle cases where a file path doesn't exist or other potential errors.

5. **Testing**: It would be beneficial to write unit tests for these functions to ensure they work as expected in different scenarios.

6. **Consistent Parameter Naming**: Ensure that parameter naming conventions are consistent across functions for better readability.

7. **Refactor**: If there are any repeated code snippets or patterns, consider refactoring to make the code more maintainable.

Overall, the code structure looks good, but applying the above improvements will enhance its quality and maintainability.
