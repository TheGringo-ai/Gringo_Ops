Thank you for the feedback! I will review and apply the improvements suggested in the config.py file. I will implement error handling for file uploads and processing, add validation for required fields, include user-friendly messages and instructions, implement structured logging, and improve code readability by breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable functions. I will also consider using a configuration management library, providing default values, and tracking changes using version control. I will update the config.py file accordingly.
```

The issue in your code was that there was no indentation before the first line. In Python, every statement must be properly indented to show its structure, with four spaces being a common convention.
