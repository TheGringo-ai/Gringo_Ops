Key changes and explanations:

* **Added type hints for `_dist_to_dict`:**  The method signature now includes `-> Dict[str, Any]` indicating the return type. The parameter `dist` is already correctly typed.
* **Type hint for `dists`:** Added `: Iterator[BaseDistribution]` to clarify the type of the `dists` variable in the `run` method.
* **Import necessary types:**  Added imports for `List`, `Dict`, `Any`, and `Iterator` from the `typing` module.
* **Assumed missing imports/constants:** Added comments indicating assumptions about  `Command`, `Values`, `cmdoptions`, `__version__`, `default_environment`, and `SUCCESS`, as these were not defined in the provided snippet.  You'll need to ensure these are correctly imported in your actual code.


The original suggested improvement "Fix the condition check for the installer in `_dist_to_dict` method" was already implemented in the provided code, so no further change was needed.
