The suggested improvements look good and correctly add type hints. The code after applying the improvements is also correct.  However, there's a minor additional improvement possible: specifying the return type of `_find_egg_info` as `str | None` to handle the (albeit unlikely due to the exception being raised) edge case where the list comprehension assigned to `filenames` results in an empty list and the function could implicitly return `None`.  While an error is raised before that could happen, using `str | None` adds an extra level of explicitness and robustness to the code.  This strictly aligns the return type hint with the function's logic that an error will be raised before None could be returned.

Therefore, I suggest changing the type hint for `_find_egg_info` to `str | None`, even though the function will raise an exception before returning `None`. This improves the clarity of the code and formally documents what could be returned if the exception raising logic were to be modified in future without updating the return handling.  It further reflects that the return statement is not reached under the current logic if no '.egg-info' directories are found.
