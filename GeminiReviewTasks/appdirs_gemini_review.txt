The suggested improvements are good, making the code cleaner and more understandable. Here are some additional comments and suggestions:

* **Consider removing the `roaming` parameter:**  The `roaming` parameter is only used on Windows.  Since this code specifically handles macOS differently and defaults to a Linux-like approach, the `roaming` concept doesn't seem relevant. Removing it simplifies the code.  If roaming profiles *are* critical, document clearly why it's included and how it interacts (or doesn't) with non-Windows systems.

* **macOS Configuration Directory Logic:** The macOS logic tries to be compatible with an existing "pip" directory in `~/Application Support`.  While well-intentioned, this creates an inconsistency.  If the goal is to be truly cross-platform, it might be better to stick with the Linux-like `~/.config` approach consistently on macOS, regardless of the presence of legacy directories. This will make the code more predictable.  If maintaining backward compatibility is essential, explain this clearly in a comment.

* **`get_site_config_dirs()` - Hardcoded "/etc":**  Hardcoding "/etc" feels a bit brittle, particularly when using `platformdirs`. Consider whether `platformdirs` provides a more robust way to get system-wide configuration directories on Unix-like systems.  If not, at least add a comment explaining the rationale behind including "/etc" specifically.

* **Docstrings could be more informative:**  While the current docstrings state *what* the functions do, they could be improved by explaining *why* or *when* you might use each function. For example, in `get_user_cache_dir()`, you could add "This directory is suitable for storing cached data that can be regenerated if necessary."

* **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling, especially in `_get_macos_user_config_dir()`.  `os.path.expanduser()` can raise an exception if the home directory is undefined. While rare, it's good practice to handle these edge cases.

* **Testing:**  The code would benefit from unit tests to ensure it behaves as expected on different platforms.

Here's an example of how some of these suggestions could be incorporated into the `get_site_config_dirs()` function:

```python
def get_site_config_dirs(appname: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Returns a list of site config directories for the specified appname.

    On Unix-like systems, this includes '/etc' in addition to the
    platform-specific locations provided by `platformdirs` to maintain
    compatibility with common system configuration practices.
    """
    if sys.platform == "darwin":
        return [_appdirs.site_data_dir(appname, appauthor=False, multipath=True)]

    dirval = _appdirs.site_config_dir(appname, appauthor=False, multipath=True)
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        return [dirval]

    # Unix-y system. Look in /etc as well.
    return dirval.split(os.pathsep) + ["/etc"]

```

By addressing these points, you can further enhance the code's readability, robustness, and maintainability.
