This code shows significant improvement compared to a version without the listed changes. The improvements enhance readability, maintainability, and robustness. Here are some further suggestions and comments:

* **Docstrings:** While the added docstrings are helpful, consider making them more comprehensive. For instance, in `InstallRequirementBackedCandidate`, explain the purpose of `source_link`, `factory`, `name`, and `version` parameters. Similarly, for other functions and classes, elaborate on the expected behavior, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.

* **Type Hinting `Factory`:**  The type hint `"Factory"` should be replaced with the actual type of the factory object. Using a string literal as a type hint postpones type checking and can lead to errors later.

* **`as_base_candidate` Function:** The utility of this function seems limited.  If the goal is type narrowing, consider using `isinstance` checks directly where needed instead of a separate function. This might improve readability. If there's a specific reason for this function, document it clearly.

* **Error Handling:** The error handling is improved. However, consider adding more context to the error messages, especially in `_prepare`. For example, in the `InstallationSubprocessError` block, include details like the command that failed. Logging the exception before raising it is also a good practice.

* **`_check_metadata_consistency`:** This method is crucial.  Ensure it covers all critical metadata aspects that need consistency checks, not just name and version.

* **Wheel Handling in `LinkCandidate`:** The wheel handling logic within the `__init__` method seems incomplete.  The code checks for a cached wheel and updates the link. However, if `cache_entry` is `None` (meaning no cached wheel), the code proceeds with the original `link`, which might not be a wheel.  This needs to be addressed.  Consider fetching the wheel if not in the cache (respecting any caching policies).  Also, what's the purpose of the `assert name == wheel_name`? This might be redundant or might indicate a larger issue if the names don't match.

* **Missing `Iterable` Import:** The `iter_dependencies` method uses `Iterable` but it's not imported. Add `from typing import Iterable` to the imports.

* **`make_install_req_from_link` and `make_install_req_from_editable`:** These functions are almost identical.  Consider refactoring to eliminate redundancy. Perhaps a single function with a flag to indicate editable vs. non-editable could be used.

* **`_make_install_req_from_dist` Optimization:**  The conditional logic for setting `line` could be slightly simplified:

   ```python
   line = str(template.req) if template.req else f"{dist.canonical_name} @ {template.link.url}" if template.link else f"{dist.canonical_name}=={dist.version}"
   ```

* **Logging:** While you have added logging, strategically add more logging at key points, especially within error handling blocks and before/after significant operations, to facilitate debugging.


By addressing these points, the code will become even more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.  The improvements you've already made are significant and demonstrate a good understanding of best practices.
