The updated code and the suggested improvements are correct and beneficial.  Adding the type hints improves readability and helps with static analysis. Here are some additional comments and potential improvements:

* **Consider `Protocol` for `InstallRequirementProvider`:**  Instead of using `Callable`, consider using `typing.Protocol` (or `typing.Callable` if using older Python versions). This allows for more precise type checking and better IDE support.  This is especially helpful if there are specific methods you expect an `InstallRequirementProvider` to have beyond just being callable.

* **Docstrings:**  Add docstrings to the `BaseResolver` class and its methods to explain their purpose and the expected behavior. Include information about the parameters and return values.

* **Clarity on `check_supported_wheels`:** In the `resolve` method, the purpose of the `check_supported_wheels` parameter is unclear.  A docstring explaining its function would be valuable.

* **`RequirementSet` vs. `List[InstallRequirement]` in `resolve`:** It might be worth considering why `resolve` returns a `RequirementSet` while `get_installation_order` operates on one and returns a `List[InstallRequirement]`. Is there a reason for this difference? Could there be a more unified approach?  This isn't necessarily a problem, but something to think about from a design perspective.

* **Error Handling:**  The `NotImplementedError` is appropriate for an abstract base class. However, in concrete implementations of this class, consider raising more specific exceptions when encountering errors during resolution or determining installation order.

Example incorporating some of these suggestions:

```python
from typing import Callable, List, Optional, Protocol

from pip._internal.req.req_install import InstallRequirement
from pip._internal.req.req_set import RequirementSet

class InstallRequirementProvider(Protocol):  # Use Protocol for better type hinting
    def __call__(self, name: str, req: Optional[InstallRequirement]) -> InstallRequirement: ...

class BaseResolver:
    """Base class for dependency resolution."""

    def resolve(
        self, root_reqs: List[InstallRequirement], check_supported_wheels: bool
    ) -> RequirementSet:
        """Resolves dependencies for the given requirements.

        Args:
            root_reqs: A list of top-level installation requirements.
            check_supported_wheels:  Flag indicating whether to check for supported wheels.
                 (Further explanation needed in concrete implementation docstrings.)

        Returns:
            A RequirementSet containing the resolved dependencies.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: This is an abstract method.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def get_installation_order(
        self, req_set: RequirementSet
    ) -> List[InstallRequirement]:
        """Determines the order in which the requirements should be installed.

        Args:
            req_set:  The resolved RequirementSet.

        Returns:
            A list of InstallRequirement objects in the order they should be installed.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: This is an abstract method.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()

```
