The suggested improvements are good and enhance the code's readability and maintainability. Here are some additional comments and potential improvements:

1. **Clarity on `_defining_class`:** The purpose of `_defining_class` isn't immediately obvious.  A comment explaining its role would be beneficial.  It seems like it's meant to ensure comparisons are only done between instances of the same class (or subclasses).  Perhaps renaming it to something like `_comparison_class` would improve clarity.  Consider also if using `type(self)` instead of a passed-in class would be simpler and less error-prone.

2. **`NotImplemented` vs `False`:**  Returning `NotImplemented` when `other` is of the wrong type is correct for comparison methods.  This signals to Python that it should try reflecting the operation (e.g., calling `other.__gt__(self)` if `self.__lt__(other)` returned `NotImplemented`).

3. **Docstrings:** Add a docstring to `KeyBasedCompareMixin` explaining its purpose and how to use it.  Include an example.  Also, docstrings for the `__init__` method would be useful.

4. **Consider `functools.total_ordering`:** The `functools.total_ordering` decorator can simplify the implementation.  By defining `__eq__` and one other comparison method (e.g., `__lt__`), `total_ordering` automatically generates the rest. This reduces boilerplate.

5. **Type hint for `key`:**  The type hint for `key` is `Any`. While flexible, it doesn't provide much information.  If possible, constrain the type of `key` to something more specific.  For example, if the key is always expected to be a string or an integer, use `Union[str, int]`.



Example incorporating some of these suggestions:


```python
from functools import total_ordering
from typing import Any, Callable, Type, Union

@total_ordering
class KeyBasedCompareMixin:
    """Provides comparison capabilities based on a key.

    Comparisons are only performed between instances of the same class
    (or subclasses).  The comparison logic is determined by the `key`
    provided during initialization.

    Example:
        >>> class MyClass(KeyBasedCompareMixin):
        ...     def __init__(self, value):
        ...         super().__init__(value, type(self))
        ...
        >>> a = MyClass(5)
        >>> b = MyClass(10)
        >>> a < b
        True

    """

    __slots__ = ["_compare_key", "_comparison_class"]

    def __init__(self, key: Any, comparison_class: Type["KeyBasedCompareMixin"]) -> None:
        """Initializes the KeyBasedCompareMixin.

        Args:
            key: The value used for comparisons.
            comparison_class:  The class used for type checking during comparisons.  Usually `type(self)`.
        """
        self._compare_key = key
        self._comparison_class = comparison_class

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self._compare_key)

    def __lt__(self, other: Any) -> bool:
        return self._compare(other, operator.__lt__)

    def __eq__(self, other: Any) -> bool:
        return self._compare(other, operator.__eq__)


    def _compare(self, other: Any, method: Callable[[Any, Any], bool]) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, self._comparison_class):
            return NotImplemented

        return method(self._compare_key, other._compare_key)

```
