Your review is a good starting point and covers many important aspects. Here's how we can make it even more helpful:

**More Specific Recommendations:**

Instead of general statements like "Ensure that the type hints are correctly defined," provide concrete examples.  If you see a function that takes a string but is typed as an int, call that out specifically.  For example:  "The `foo` function's `bar` parameter is typed as `int` but appears to be used as a string in the `baz` call."

The same goes for error handling and logging.  Instead of "Make sure that error messages are informative," consider: "The `InstallationError` raised in the `_install_build_reqs` function could include the stderr output from the subprocess call to help diagnose installation failures."  Or regarding logging: "Consider adding debug logging within the `_prepare_build_backend` function to track the execution flow and the values of key variables like `backend_path`."

**Deeper Dive into Functionality:**

The review mentions "_prepare_build_backend" and "_install_build_reqs" being crucial. Explain *why* they are crucial and what potential failure modes might occur.  For example: "_prepare_build_backend appears to handle isolation.  It should be tested with various backend directory structures to ensure proper isolation and cleanup.  A potential issue could be inadvertently modifying the project's own environment."

**Consider Security Implications:**

Since `_install_build_reqs` likely executes external commands, mention the importance of sanitizing inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.  This is a critical security consideration.

**PEP 517 Specifics:**

Since the code deals with PEP 517, consider mentioning best practices related to build backend compatibility and handling different build systems.  Is the code robust enough to handle different backends and their quirks?

**Example of an improved comment on `_prepare_build_backend`:**

"The `_prepare_build_backend` function creates an isolated environment for the build backend.  However, it's unclear how it handles cleanup after the build process completes.  It should ensure temporary directories are removed to avoid disk space leaks. Additionally, consider logging the location of the isolated environment for debugging purposes. Since this function interacts with the file system, it should be thoroughly tested to handle potential exceptions like `PermissionError` and `FileNotFoundError`.  It would be beneficial to see examples in the test suite that cover creating the environment in different locations (e.g., a user's home directory vs. a system temporary directory) to ensure consistent behavior."

**Structure of the Review:**

Consider organizing the review by function/method instead of by general topic (typing, error handling, etc.). This allows for more focused and actionable feedback.

By being more specific and delving deeper into the code's functionality and potential issues, you can make your code reviews significantly more valuable.
