**Comments and Suggested Improvements Applied:**

* **Import Statements:**  Reorganized into standard library, third-party, then internal/local imports, separated by blank lines.  Added example third-party (requests) and internal imports to demonstrate the grouping.
* **Type Annotations:** Added type annotations to `search`, `highest_version`, and `main` parameters and return types using `List`, `Tuple`, and `Optional`.
* **Assert Statement Replacement:** The `assert limit >= 0` is replaced with `if limit < 0: raise ValueError("Limit must be non-negative.")`. This provides a more informative error message and is generally preferred over assertions for runtime error handling.
* **Empty Versions List Handling:** The `highest_version` function now explicitly handles the case where the input `versions` list is empty by returning `None`. This prevents the `max()` function from raising an exception.



These changes improve the code's readability, maintainability, and robustness. The type annotations, in particular, make the code easier to understand and help catch potential errors earlier.  The improved error handling in both `search` and `highest_version` makes the code more reliable.
