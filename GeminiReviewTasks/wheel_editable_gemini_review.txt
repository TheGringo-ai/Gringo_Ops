The improved code is a good step forward, but here are some further suggestions:

1. **More Specific Exception Handling:** While the code catches `HookMissing`, the generic `Exception` handler still catches a broad range of potential issues.  Consider catching more specific exceptions related to file system access (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`), subprocess errors (e.g., `CalledProcessError` if using `subprocess.run` within the backend), and perhaps even specific exceptions that the `build_editable` hook might raise.  This allows for more targeted error messages. For instance, if the build fails because a file is missing, the user should get a message telling them *which* file.

2. **Check `wheel_name` before using it:**  The code assumes `wheel_name` is always returned by `backend.build_editable()`, even if no errors are raised. Add a check to ensure `wheel_name` is not `None` or empty before using it in `os.path.join`. This prevents potential errors if the backend returns unexpected output.

3. **Consider logging the `metadata_directory`:** For debugging purposes, it might be helpful to log the `metadata_directory` similar to how `tempd` is logged.

4. **Clarify the `HookMissing` message:**  The error message "Cannot build editable ... because the build backend does not have the {e} hook" is correct but could be improved.  Consider adding context, for example: "Cannot build editable {name} because the selected build backend ({backend.__class__.__name__}) does not have the required {e} hook.  You may need to install a different build backend or configure a different backend in pyproject.toml."

5. **Document the expected format of `wheel_name`:** Add a comment explaining whether `wheel_name` is expected to be just the filename, or a relative path. This clarifies the expected interaction between `backend.build_editable` and the subsequent `os.path.join`.


Example incorporating some of these suggestions:

```python
# ... other imports

def build_wheel_editable(
    # ... function parameters
) -> Optional[str]:
    """... (docstring)"""
    assert metadata_directory is not None
    logger.debug(f"Destination directory: {tempd}")
    logger.debug(f"Metadata directory: {metadata_directory}")

    try:
        runner = runner_with_spinner_message(f"Building editable for {name} (pyproject.toml)")
        with backend.subprocess_runner(runner):
            try:
                wheel_name = backend.build_editable(
                    tempd, metadata_directory=metadata_directory
                )
                if not wheel_name:  # Check if wheel_name is valid
                    logger.error(f"Build backend for {name} returned an invalid wheel name.")
                    return None
            except HookMissing as e:
                logger.error(f"Cannot build editable {name} because the selected build backend ({backend.__class__.__name__}) does not have the required {e} hook.  You may need to install a different build backend or configure a different backend in pyproject.toml.") # More informative message
                return None
            # Example of more specific exception handling:
            except FileNotFoundError as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed building editable for {name}: File not found: {e}")
                return None
            # ... catch other relevant exceptions

    except Exception as ex: # Catch remaining unexpected exceptions
        logger.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred while building editable for {name}: {ex}") # Use logger.exception to include traceback
        return None

    #  (Add comment here: Is wheel_name just the filename or a relative path?)
    return os.path.join(tempd, wheel_name)

```
These improvements will lead to more robust and informative error handling, making it easier to diagnose and resolve build issues. Remember to adapt the specific exceptions caught to the potential errors your `backend.build_editable` function could encounter.
