The code has some good improvements with the addition of input validation. Here are a few suggestions for further enhancements:

1. **Handle Empty Files:**  The current `FileNotFoundError` handling returns an empty list. While this prevents a crash, it might lead to unexpected behavior later. Consider raising a `ValueError` or a custom exception if either file is empty after reading, as this likely indicates an issue with the input data.  This would prevent generating a quiz with no questions or answers.


2. **More Robust File Reading:** The `read_file` method could be made more robust by handling other potential file-reading issues, such as incorrect file formats or encoding problems.  A more general `IOError` or `OSError` catch could be used.


3. **Improved Random Question Selection:** Currently, the `generate_quiz` method uses `random.randint`.  This has a small chance of selecting the same question multiple times, especially if `num_questions` is a significant portion of the total number of questions.  Using `random.sample` would guarantee unique questions:
   ```python
   indices = random.sample(range(len(self.questions)), num_questions)
   for index in indices:
       # ... rest of the loop
   ```


4. **`num_questions` Validation:**  The `generate_quiz` method doesn't check if `num_questions` is valid (e.g., not negative, not larger than the available number of questions).  Adding a check would prevent unexpected behavior:
   ```python
   if num_questions <= 0 or num_questions > len(self.questions):
       raise ValueError("Invalid number of questions requested.")
   ```

5. **Clearer Error Messages:** While the `ValueError` for mismatched file lengths is good, the `FileNotFoundError` handling just prints to the console.  It would be beneficial to raise an exception or return an error status so the calling code can handle the situation appropriately.

6. **Consider Case-Insensitive Comparison in `generate_quiz()`:** You are already performing case-insensitive comparison in the testing section. You may want to consider doing the same in the `generate_quiz()` function for consistency.

7. **Separate Quiz Generation from Quiz Administration:**  The main execution block currently handles both quiz generation and the quiz itself.  Consider separating these into distinct functions to improve code organization. This would make it easier to reuse the `QuizGenerator` for different quiz interfaces (e.g., a GUI or web application).


8. **Docstrings:**  Add docstrings to the class and its methods to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values. This will significantly improve code readability and maintainability.


By incorporating these suggestions, the code will become more robust, user-friendly, and easier to maintain.
