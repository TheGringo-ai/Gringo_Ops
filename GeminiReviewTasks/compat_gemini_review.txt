The updated code looks good and addresses the points raised for improvement. Here's a breakdown of why each change is positive:

1. **Type Hinting for `has_tls`:**  Adding `-> bool` clarifies the return type of the function, improving readability and enabling static analysis tools to catch potential errors.

2. **`os.O_RDONLY` (No Change Needed):** The original suggestion was to change `os.O_RDONLY` to `os.O_RDONLY`, which is redundant. The provided code correctly uses `os.O_RDONLY`.

3. **`os.open` Context Manager:** Using `with os.open(...)` ensures that the file descriptor is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur. This is a best practice for resource management.

4. **`os.path.islink`:** Using `os.path.islink` is more platform-independent and preferable over just `os.islink`.

5. **Raising `ValueError` for Symlinks:**  Changing the raised exception to `ValueError` is a good choice. `OSError` is too generic. `ValueError` more accurately reflects the situation where a function receives an inappropriate value (a symlink in this case when it expects a regular file).  This makes debugging easier.

**Minor Suggestions (Not critical but could further enhance the code):**

* **Docstring for `has_tls`:** While not strictly necessary, a brief docstring explaining the purpose of `has_tls` would be helpful.  For example:  `"""Check if TLS/SSL support is available."""`

* **Consider `FileNotFoundError`:**  In the `else` block of `get_path_uid`, if the file doesn't exist, a regular `OSError` is raised.  It might be more informative to raise a `FileNotFoundError` in this specific scenario. This will allow calling code to handle file not found situations differently than other OS errors.

* **Comment Clarity in `get_path_uid`:** The comment "AIX and Jython" could be slightly clearer.  Something like "Handles platforms lacking os.O_NOFOLLOW (e.g., older AIX and Jython)" would provide more context.


Overall, the updated code is significantly improved in terms of clarity, robustness, and maintainability. The suggested changes effectively address the initial concerns and incorporate best practices.
