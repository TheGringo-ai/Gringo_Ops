1. **Hash Validation in `ArchiveInfo`:** The `hash` setter in `ArchiveInfo` currently parses the hash value but doesn't perform any validation on the `hash_name` or `hash_value`. Consider adding validation to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., using regex).  This would prevent potentially invalid hash information from being stored.

2. **Immutability of `ArchiveInfo.hashes`:** The `hash` setter modifies `self.hashes` directly if it's already set. This breaks immutability, which can lead to unexpected side effects. Create a new `hashes` dictionary instead of modifying the existing one in-place.  Change the line  `self.hashes = self.hashes.copy()` to `self.hashes = dict(self.hashes)` for efficiency. Add this to the condition where `self.hashes is None` as well,  `self.hashes = {hash_name: hash_value}` should become `self.hashes = dict({hash_name: hash_value})`.

3. **Docstring for `redacted_url`:** The docstring for `redacted_url` could be more descriptive. Explain *why* the URL is redacted (e.g., to remove sensitive authentication information) and *what* parts are redacted.  For example:  "Returns a redacted version of the URL, removing username and password from the netloc unless it's an environment variable or a 'git' URL."

4. **Overriding `__eq__` and `__hash__`:** Consider implementing `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods for the `VcsInfo`, `ArchiveInfo`, `DirInfo`, and `DirectUrl` classes. This would allow for proper comparison and use in sets or dictionaries.

5. **Type Hinting for `ArchiveInfo.hashes`:** The type hint for `ArchiveInfo.hashes` is `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`.  Be more specific by using `Optional[Dict[str, str]]` consistently (it's used in the constructor but not the property).

6. **Direct Access to `info`:** The `info` attribute of `DirectUrl` is directly accessible. Consider making it a property and providing a getter method, which would allow for more controlled access and potential validation in the future.

7. **Consider `dataclasses`:** The `VcsInfo`, `ArchiveInfo`, and `DirInfo` classes are primarily data containers.  Using `dataclasses` could simplify their definitions and automatically generate methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.

8. **Descriptive Error in `_remove_auth_from_netloc`:** Although unlikely, the function `_remove_auth_from_netloc` implicitly assumes the presence of "@" in the netloc splits into two parts.  If there are multiple "@" characters, this could lead to unexpected behavior. A more robust approach would be to split only once from the right.

9. **Redundancy in  `validate` method:** The `validate` method currently reconstructs the object from its dictionary representation. While this can catch inconsistencies, it's not very efficient. Consider more targeted validation checks, focusing on the most likely sources of errors. Or remove it as the `from_dict` and `to_dict` methods already provide implicit validation during conversion.


These improvements will enhance the code's robustness, readability, and maintainability.
