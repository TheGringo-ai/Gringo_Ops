The suggested improvements are generally good and would enhance the `req_command.py` file. Here's a more detailed breakdown and some additional considerations:

**1. Docstrings:**  Absolutely essential.  Explain the purpose of each class and method, parameters, and return values. Use clear and concise language.

**2. Type Hinting `wrapper`:**  Yes, this improves readability and helps with static analysis. Specify the return type explicitly.

**3. Try-Except in `_build_session`:** Crucial.  Network operations, file system access, and other operations within `_build_session` can raise exceptions. Catching and handling them prevents crashes and provides informative error messages. Consider specifying the types of exceptions you expect (e.g., `IOError`, network errors).

**4. Handling `temp_build_dir.path`:**  Very important. Temporary directories can sometimes fail to be created. Check for `None` or use a try-except block to handle potential errors.  Consider using a more robust temporary directory creation mechanism if the current one is prone to issues.

**5. Exception Handling in `get_requirements`:**  Definitely needed.  The `install_req_from_parsed_requirement` method likely performs operations that could raise exceptions (e.g., dependency resolution failures, network issues). Catching and handling these is crucial for robustness.

**6. Comment for `warn_if_run_as_root`:** A brief comment explaining *why* running as root is discouraged is important.  For example, it could mention security risks or unintended file ownership issues.

**7. Removing Unused `partial` Import:** Correct. Remove unused imports to keep the code cleaner.

**8. Refactoring for Readability and Maintainability:**  This is a key suggestion.  Large, complex methods can be difficult to understand and debug.  Breaking them down into smaller, more focused functions improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.  Identify logical units of work within these methods and extract them into separate functions.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Logging:**  Consider adding logging throughout the code. This is invaluable for debugging and monitoring the behavior of the script, especially in production environments.
* **Unit Tests:**  If the code doesn't have unit tests, strongly recommend adding them. This will make refactoring safer and help ensure the code works as expected.
* **Input Validation:** If the script takes any user input or reads data from external sources, validate this input thoroughly to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* **Context Managers:**  For resources like files or network connections, use context managers (the `with` statement) to ensure proper cleanup, even if exceptions occur.
* **Constants:** If there are any hardcoded values (e.g., file paths, URLs), consider replacing them with constants defined at the top of the file. This makes it easier to change these values later.


By addressing these suggestions and considerations, you'll significantly improve the quality, robustness, and maintainability of the `req_command.py` script.
