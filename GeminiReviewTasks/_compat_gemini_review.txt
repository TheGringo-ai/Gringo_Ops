You've provided a good starting point for reviewing a `_compat.py` file.  Here are some expanded and refined suggestions based on your initial points, focusing on what we might typically find in such a file (compatibility shims):

**General Improvements**

* **Docstrings:**  Add comprehensive docstrings to all classes and methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised.  This is crucial for compatibility libraries as users need to understand how the behavior might differ across platforms/versions.  Use clear and concise language.
* **Version Checks:**  Instead of blanket `try...except` blocks, use explicit version checks (e.g., `if sys.version_info < (3, 7):`) where possible. This improves readability and makes it easier to understand which code path is taken for specific Python versions.  Document which versions are supported.
* **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the compatibility layer across all supported Python versions and platforms.  This is especially important for edge cases. Consider using tools like `tox` to automate testing.
* **Module Docstring:** Add a module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the `_compat.py` file itself, which versions it aims to support, and any general usage notes.

**Regarding the `BasePath` Class**

* **Abstract Base Class (ABC):**  If `BasePath` is designed to provide a common interface for different path implementations (e.g., pathlib's `Path`, older `os.path` functions), consider making it an abstract base class. This enforces the required interface for concrete implementations and clarifies the design. (Use `abc.ABC` or `typing.Protocol` if you are type hinting).
* **Method Implementation:**  Instead of raising `NotImplementedError` directly in the base class's methods, either define them as abstract methods (if using an ABC) or provide default implementations that might raise `NotImplementedError` if not overridden by a subclass.  The goal is to give subclasses a chance to provide the appropriate platform-specific behavior.
* **Type Hinting `Path` objects:** If you are dealing with file paths, use `pathlib.Path` for type hinting whenever possible. It's more informative than simply `str` or `bytes`.
* **Context Manager (`__enter__` and `__exit__`):** If appropriate for your `BasePath` operations, consider implementing the context manager protocol to allow usage like: `with BasePath(...) as path_obj: ...`  This can be helpful for managing resources.

**Example of improved `BasePath` (using ABC):**

```python
#  (Conceptual Example - Not runnable without complete implementation)

import abc
import pathlib
import sys

class BasePath(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class defining a common interface for path operations."""

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def join(self, *args: str) -> "BasePath":
        """Join path components.  Subclasses must implement."""
        raise NotImplementedError  # This is OK in an abstract method.

    @property
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """Return the final path component."""
        raise NotImplementedError


class PathlibBasePath(BasePath):
    """BasePath implementation using pathlib."""

    def __init__(self, path_str: str):
        self._path: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path(path_str)

    def join(self, *args: str) -> "PathlibBasePath":
       return PathlibBasePath(str(self._path.joinpath(*args)))

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._path.name


#  Example usage (assuming appropriate other methods are implemented):
if sys.version_info >= (3, 6): # Example version check
   path_obj = PathlibBasePath("/tmp")
   new_path = path_obj.join("subdir", "file.txt")
   print(new_path.name)  # Output: file.txt

```


By applying these principles to your specific `_compat.py` file, you'll create a more robust, maintainable, and understandable compatibility layer. Remember to always thoroughly document and test your code, especially when dealing with cross-version compatibility.
