This code has several positive aspects, like the use of type hints and the descriptive function names. However, there are a few points that could be improved:

1. **Overuse of `HiddenText` for command redaction:**  The use of `HiddenText` and the related functions (`format_command_args`, `reveal_command_args`) seems overly complex for redacting secrets in command arguments.  Consider simplifying this by directly replacing sensitive values with placeholders like `****` before logging or displaying the command. This would avoid the need for a custom class and associated functions.  For the actual execution, use the unredacted command.

2. **`create_command` function is redundant:** The `create_command` function doesn't seem to add much value.  It essentially flattens a list of lists/strings into a single list. This could be done inline where it's needed, making the code more concise.

3. **`execute_subprocess` function complexity:** This function has a lot of parameters.  Consider if some of these could be grouped into a data class or if some are rarely used and could be removed. This would improve readability and maintainability. Specifically, `show_stdout` and `stdout_only` seem related and could potentially be simplified.

4. **Logging in `execute_subprocess`:** The logging logic inside `execute_subprocess` might become quite complex with all the different options. Consider extracting the logging functionality into a separate helper function to improve readability and testability.

5. **Spinner usage in `execute_with_spinner_message`:** The `execute_with_spinner_message` function is a good example of a higher-order function. However, consider if the `message` argument could also be a callable that takes the current state/progress and returns a dynamic message for the spinner.  This would provide more flexibility in updating the spinner message during long-running processes.

6. **Error Handling:** While the improvements mention adding exception handling, the provided code snippet doesn't demonstrate it. Ensure `execute_subprocess` correctly handles exceptions from `subprocess.Popen` (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`) and raises appropriate custom exceptions like `InstallationSubprocessError` with informative error messages.  Include the command that failed in the exception message, preferably the redacted version if secrets are involved.

7. **Documentation:**  The docstrings could be improved by adding examples and clarifying the behavior for different parameter combinations, especially for the more complex parameters like `on_returncode`, `extra_ok_returncodes`, and the interaction between `show_stdout` and `stdout_only`.

8. **Type Hinting `execute_subprocess` return value:** Currently, the return type of `execute_subprocess` is `str`.  It's unclear whether this returns stdout, stderr, or both.  Clarify the docstring and consider changing the return type to be more specific (e.g., `str`, `Tuple[str, str]`, or a namedtuple) depending on the intended behavior of `stdout_only`.  If `stdout_only` is True, it should return only stdout.


By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the readability, maintainability, and robustness of the code.
