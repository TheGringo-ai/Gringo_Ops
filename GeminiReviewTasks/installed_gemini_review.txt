The provided code snippet looks correct regarding the requested type hint additions for the `prepare_distribution_metadata` method. However, simply adding type hints and showing a small, isolated piece of code isn't enough to validate proper integration within a larger codebase.  Here's a breakdown of further checks and considerations:

* **Context within `pip._internal.distributions`:**  How does `InstalledDistribution` interact with other classes in this module?  Does this implementation of `prepare_distribution_metadata` (doing nothing) make sense given the broader responsibilities of the `AbstractDistribution` class and its other subclasses?  There might be implicit assumptions about the side effects of this method that need to be considered if it's now a no-op for installed distributions.

* **Usage of `InstalledDistribution`:** How and where is this class instantiated and used within the `pip` codebase?  Review these usage sites to ensure the new type hints don't cause any type errors.  Pay particular attention to any dynamic or reflection-based code that might interact with this method.

* **Testing:** The most critical validation step is thorough testing. Existing tests covering installation scenarios within `pip` should be run to ensure they still pass.  Ideally, new tests specifically targeting `InstalledDistribution` and its interaction with `PackageFinder` (and the `build_isolation` and `check_build_deps` flags) should be added.  Test cases should cover various installation scenarios, including different package types (e.g., wheels, sdists), installation options, and edge cases.

* **Documentation:**  The docstring for `prepare_distribution_metadata` within `AbstractDistribution` (and perhaps within `InstalledDistribution` as well) should be updated to reflect the behavior for installed distributions.  This helps clarify the intended usage and expectations.

* **Impact on `PackageFinder`:** Does the fact that `prepare_distribution_metadata` is a no-op for installed distributions have any implications for the logic within `PackageFinder`? Review the places where this method is called to ensure that the `PackageFinder`'s behavior remains consistent.


In summary, the code change itself looks fine in isolation, but without analyzing its integration within the `pip` codebase and without comprehensive testing, it's impossible to guarantee correctness.  Focus on the points above to thoroughly validate the change and prevent regressions.
