The code has seen significant improvements in terms of type hinting, docstrings, and PEP8 compliance. However, there are still some potential enhancements:

1. **`_get_svn_url_rev` Exception Handling:** The `try...except InstallationError` block in `_get_svn_url_rev` could be improved. It catches a broad `InstallationError` and simply sets `url` and `revs` to default values. It would be more helpful to log the specific error or potentially reraise a more descriptive exception explaining why SVN info retrieval failed. Consider catching a more specific exception related to the `run_command` failure (e.g., a subclass of `InstallationError` specific to command execution issues).  This gives callers more information to act on.

2. **`get_revision` Simplification:** The logic in `get_revision` can be simplified. The `assert dirurl is not None` is redundant because if `base == location` and `dirurl` is None, the function will already have returned due to `RemoteNotFoundError` raised in `_get_svn_url_rev`.  Consider using a `for...else` construct to handle the case where no revisions are found more elegantly instead of initializing `revision` to 0.


3. **`get_remote_url` Error Message:**  The error message in `get_remote_url` could be more specific. Instead of just saying "Could not find Python project," it might be better to indicate that a `.svn` directory could not be found within the project or its parent directories, as that is the actual problem.  Clarify whether this method is intended to find the root of a Python project or the root of an SVN checkout.  These might not be the same thing.

4. **Redundant `should_add_vcs_url_prefix`:** The `should_add_vcs_url_prefix` method always returns `True` and doesn't appear to be used anywhere. Consider removing it unless it's required for future compatibility.

5. **`call_vcs_version` Error Handling:**  `call_vcs_version` returns an empty tuple if the SVN version string is not in the expected format or if integer parsing fails. It would be better to log a warning message in these cases, as this could indicate a problem with the SVN installation.

6. **`get_vcs_version` Caching:** While caching `_vcs_version` is generally good, consider adding a mechanism to refresh the cache if needed. This would be useful if the SVN version somehow changes during a session.  Perhaps add a force-refresh parameter.

7. **Unclear `use_interactive` Logic:** The logic around `use_interactive` and `get_remote_call_options` could be clarified. Explain more clearly when the `--non-interactive`, `--force-interactive`, and no-option scenarios are chosen and why.  It might be helpful to add a small comment explaining the rationale behind choosing different options based on SVN version.

8. **Consider `pathlib`:** Using `pathlib` for path manipulation (instead of `os.path`) could improve code readability and make it more object-oriented.

9. **`make_rev_args` Type Hinting:**  `HiddenText` is likely not needed in `make_rev_args` signature.  Consider using `Optional[str]` for both `username` and `password`.  Explain in the docstring why `password` might need hiding.


By addressing these points, you can further improve the robustness, readability, and maintainability of the code.
