Key changes and explanations:

* **Added missing type hints:**  Added type hints for `from_directory`, `from_metadata_file_contents`, and `from_wheel`.  Used forward references (e.g., `"BaseDistribution"`) where necessary, assuming these classes are defined elsewhere in the code.
* **Improved `iter_distutils_script_names` type hint and return value:** Replaced `Union[Iterator[str], Any]` with `Optional[Iterator[str]]` for better clarity and type safety.  The function now returns `None` instead of implicitly ending when the condition is not met, ensuring consistency with the type hint.
* **Added `InfoPath` type alias:** Created an `InfoPath` type alias for `Union[str, pathlib.PurePosixPath]` for better readability and maintainability, assuming this type is used in other parts of the code as well.
* **No changes to already correctly typed methods:** Pointed out that the type hints requested for `read_text` (twice), `from_zipfile`, `is_file`, `iter_entry_points`, `iter_provided_extras`, and `iter_dependencies` were already present and correct.  No modifications were made to these.

By addressing these points, the code's type hinting is more complete and consistent, improving readability, maintainability, and allowing for better static analysis. Remember to import necessary modules like `typing` and any custom classes used in type hints (e.g., `BaseDistribution`, `Wheel`, `Requirement`, `BaseEntryPoint`, `UnsupportedWheel`, `InvalidWheel`).
