This code has seen significant improvements compared to a version that might have relied on `pip._internal`.  However, there's still room for refinement:

**1. Further Simplification of `with_cached_index_content`:**

The nested wrapper structure can be simplified using a single function with a check inside:

```python
def with_cached_index_content(fn):
    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def cached_wrapper(page: IndexContent) -> List[Link]:
        return list(fn(page))

    @functools.wraps(fn)
    def wrapper(page: IndexContent) -> List[Link]:
        return cached_wrapper(page) if page.cache_link_parsing else list(fn(page))

    return wrapper
```

**2. More Robust Exception Handling in `_get_index_content`:**

The `try...except` block can be restructured to be more specific and informative. Catching `requests.exceptions.RequestException` is generally too broad.  Consider catching more specific exceptions like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` or `requests.exceptions.Timeout` and handling them differently.  Also, consider adding a retry mechanism. Example:

```python
from requests.exceptions import RetryError, ConnectionError, Timeout

def _get_index_content(...):
    try:
        resp = _get_simple_response(url, session=session)
    except _NotHTTP: # ... (Existing code)
    except _NotAPIContent as exc: # ... (Existing code)
    except (ConnectionError, Timeout) as exc:
        logger.warning("Connection error fetching %s: %s", link, exc)
        # Consider retrying here
    except RetryError as exc:
        logger.error("Failed to fetch %s after multiple retries: %s", link, exc)
    except requests.HTTPError as exc:  # Keep this separate for HTTP errors
        _handle_get_simple_fail(link, f"HTTP status code {exc.response.status_code}")
    else: # ... (Existing code)
    return None
```


**3.  Clarity in Logging:**

*   In `_handle_get_simple_fail`, use `logger.info` if the failure is expected (e.g., a 404) and `logger.warning` or `logger.error` if it's unexpected.
*   Include the URL in the warning message in `_NotHTTP` and `_NotAPIContent` exceptions.
*  Use f-strings consistently for logging, as you've done in most places.

**4.  Type Hinting Consistency:**

*  Although you've addressed most type hinting, review all function signatures and variables to ensure complete coverage and consistency. For example, `_handle_get_simple_fail` is missing type hints. Consider adding type hints for `meth` to indicate it's a callable.

**5.  Docstrings:**

*  Ensure *all* functions and classes have clear, concise docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.  The provided code snippet lacks docstrings in several places (e.g., `_make_index_content`).


**6.  Consider Using `requests.Session`'s Retry Functionality:**

Instead of implementing your own retry mechanism, you can configure the `requests.Session` object with retry logic using the `Retry` adapter. This would simplify your code and provide more robust retry behavior.

**7. Minor Improvements:**

*   In `_get_encoding_from_headers`, the `str(charset)` is redundant since `m.get_param("charset")` already returns a string.

By implementing these changes, you'll further improve the code's readability, robustness, and maintainability. Remember to thoroughly test the changes to ensure they don't introduce regressions.
