The code looks good overall, with the docstrings providing clear explanations of each parameter. Here are a few minor suggestions:

1. **Default value for `format_control`:**  The docstring mentions `format_control` can be `None`, but the type hint specifies `Optional[FormatControl]`.  While this works, it's generally better to explicitly set the default value to `None` in the parameter list for clarity:

   ```python
   format_control: Optional[FormatControl] = None, 
   ```

2. **Docstring for `ignore_requires_python`:** The docstring states, "Defaults to False."  Since you are explicitly setting it to `False` if it's `None`, consider rephrasing to "If `None`, defaults to `False`." This slight change clarifies the logic more precisely.

3. **Type hint for `format_control` when `None`:** While technically correct, using `Optional[FormatControl]` might be slightly redundant since the default value is `None`.  If you want to be extra strict, you could change it to `FormatControl | None` using the more concise type union operator (Python 3.10+). If maintaining code for python versions before 3.10, `Union[FormatControl, None]` is the equivalent and requires the `from typing import Union` import at the top. However, using `Optional` is a common practice and works perfectly well.

4. **Consider adding examples to the docstring:**  While the descriptions are good, a simple example could further enhance understanding, especially for `format_control`.

   ```python
   """Create a SelectionPreferences object.

   :param format_control: ... Example: `FormatControl(set(["binary"]))` to prefer binary packages.
   ...
   """
   ```

5.  **Consider validating the type of `format_control`:** Although not strictly necessary, you might add a check within the `__init__` to ensure `format_control` is either a `FormatControl` instance or `None` to prevent unexpected errors later. This could be done like so:
    ```python
    from pip._internal.exceptions import InvalidArguments

    #... inside __init__ ...
    if format_control is not None and not isinstance(format_control, FormatControl):
        raise InvalidArguments(f"format_control must be None or FormatControl instance, got: {type(format_control)}")
    ```


These are just minor suggestions; the code is already in good shape. The most important change is probably adding a simple example to the docstring for `format_control`.
