The provided review and revised code are a good start, but there are several areas that can be further improved:

**General Comments:**

* **Incomplete Code Example:** The provided code snippet only shows the `PipSession` class and related methods.  It's missing the imports, other classes like `LocalFSAdapter`, and the `user_agent` and `looks_like_ci` functions, making it hard to fully assess the changes.
* **Missing Context:**  What is the purpose of this `PipSession` class?  Is it intended to be a drop-in replacement for `requests.Session` specifically for pip?  Understanding the context will help make better suggestions.
* **Dependency Management:**  The code relies on several external libraries (e.g., `requests`, `urllib3`, `cachecontrol`).  Make sure these dependencies are clearly documented (e.g., in a `requirements.txt` file).


**Specific Comments:**

1. **Type Hinting Improvements:** While the review mentions adding type hints, several opportunities are missed in the provided code:
    * `trusted_hosts` in `__init__` should be `List[str]`.
    * `index_urls` in `__init__` should be `Optional[List[str]]`.
    * `ssl_context` in `__init__` needs a correct type hint (it currently uses a string literal).  The correct type is `ssl.SSLContext` (after importing `ssl`).
    * Return type of `add_trusted_host` should be `None`.

2. **`LocalFSAdapter` Improvements:**  The review correctly identifies the need for a context manager in the `send` method, but the revised code doesn't include this change. The `io.BytesIO` removal is a good suggestion.  An example implementation would be helpful.

3. **`user_agent` Readability:** The review suggests improving the readability of long dictionary data in `user_agent`, but doesn't provide a concrete solution. Consider using a multi-line dictionary or breaking down the dictionary creation into smaller, more manageable parts.

4. **`looks_like_ci` Type Hints:** As mentioned above, the code for this function is missing, so the type hint suggestions can't be evaluated.

5. **Docstrings:** The provided code includes a docstring for the `__init__` method, which is a good start.  However, docstrings should be added to *all* public methods and classes to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.  The existing docstring for `__init__` could also be more comprehensive. For example, explain the purpose of each parameter.

6. **Error Handling:**  The `add_trusted_host` method raises a `ValueError` if the host is invalid.  Consider adding similar error handling to other methods where appropriate.

7. **`PipSession` Purpose and Design:** As mentioned in the general comments, clarifying the purpose of this class is important.  If it's meant to be a specialized session for pip, consider naming it more explicitly (e.g., `PipHttpAdapter` or customizing the existing adapters instead of subclassing the session).  It's not clear why `pip_trusted_origins` needs to store both hostname and port if mounting already handles that distinction.


**Example of `LocalFSAdapter.send` improvement:**

```python
class LocalFSAdapter(requests.adapters.BaseAdapter):  # Example, needs full implementation
    def send(self, request, **kwargs):
        path = request.url[7:] # remove "file:///"

        try:
            with open(path, 'rb') as f:
                resp = requests.Response()
                resp.raw = f
                resp.status_code = 200
                resp.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes
                return resp
        except OSError as e:
            resp = requests.Response()
            resp.status_code = 404  # Or other appropriate error code
            resp.reason = str(e)
            raise HTTPError(resp.reason, response=resp)

```

By addressing these points, the code can be made more robust, readable, and maintainable. Remember to provide complete code examples for a more thorough review.
