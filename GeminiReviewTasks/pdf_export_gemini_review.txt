The provided code is a good start but can be improved in several ways:

1. **More Robust Filename Validation:** While the provided regex catches some common invalid characters, it's not exhaustive and platform-dependent.  Windows has a more restrictive set of invalid characters than Unix-like systems. Consider using a dedicated library like `pathvalidate` for more comprehensive and cross-platform filename sanitization.

2. **Handle `pdfkit` Errors More Specifically:** Catching a generic `Exception` can mask underlying issues with `pdfkit`. It's better to catch `pdfkit.PDFKitError` specifically, allowing other exceptions (like `TypeError` if `data` isn't a string) to propagate up for debugging. This provides more informative error messages.

3. **Return Success/Failure:** Instead of just printing success or failure, the function should return a boolean value indicating whether the export was successful. This allows calling code to react programmatically to the result.

4. **Configuration Options for `pdfkit`:** The `pdfkit` library allows for various configuration options (like specifying the path to `wkhtmltopdf`). Consider making the `pdfkit` options configurable, either via optional function arguments or a separate configuration object. This allows greater flexibility.

5. **Docstring Improvements:** The docstring is minimal. Expand it to include:
    *  A clearer explanation of what the function does.
    *  Explicitly mention the invalid characters being checked for (or if using a library, mention the library used for validation).
    *  Specify the return value (boolean indicating success/failure).
    *  Document any optional arguments if added (e.g., for `pdfkit` configuration).

6. **Testing:** The provided test case is very basic. Add more tests to cover various scenarios, including:
    *  Filenames with invalid characters (on different operating systems if possible).
    *  Different data types (to test error handling).
    *  Cases where `pdfkit` might fail (e.g., `wkhtmltopdf` not found).


Example of some of the improvements (not including platform-specific filename validation or significantly expanded testing):

```python
import pdfkit

def export_to_pdf(data, filename, options=None):
    """Exports data to a PDF file.

    Uses pdfkit to convert the provided data to a PDF file.  The filename is
    checked for invalid characters.

    Args:
        data: The string data to be exported.
        filename: The name of the output PDF file.
        options: Optional dictionary of options for pdfkit.

    Returns:
        True if the export was successful, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        # ... (Improved filename validation using a dedicated library)
        pdfkit.from_string(data, filename, options=options)
        return True

    except pdfkit.PDFKitError as e:
        print(f"pdfkit error: {e}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:  # Catch other unexpected errors.
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return False


# Test cases (need to be expanded).
data = "This is a sample data to be exported to a PDF file"
success = export_to_pdf(data, "sample.pdf")
print(f"Export successful: {success}")

```
