The code is mostly well-written and the improvements listed are good ones. Here are a few additional suggestions:

1. **Default Shell:** Consider providing a default shell if none is specified.  This could be based on the current environment (e.g., `$SHELL`) or simply defaulting to bash, which is common. This improves user experience as they don't *have* to specify a shell.

2. **Error Handling - Return Code:** While the comment says "the code is valid," returning `SUCCESS` after printing an error message to `stderr` is misleading.  Change the return code to an error code (e.g., 1) when an invalid shell is specified. This allows scripting and automation to detect the failure.

3. **Help Message Improvement:**  The help messages could be slightly improved to indicate exclusivity. For example:

   ```
   --bash, -b     Emit completion code for bash (mutually exclusive with other shell options).
   ```

4. **Consider `argparse`:**  `optparse` is deprecated.  While it still works, migrating to `argparse` is recommended for newer code and offers more features.  `argparse` also has built-in mutually exclusive argument group support, simplifying the logic and help text related to selecting only one shell.

5. **Input Validation:** While the current code handles unknown shells, consider adding validation to ensure *only* one shell option is provided.  `argparse`'s mutually exclusive groups make this easy, but even with `optparse`, a check could be added.

6. **`COMPLETION_SCRIPTS` - Minor Formatting:**  The indentation within the multiline strings in `COMPLETION_SCRIPTS` might be slightly excessive. While not strictly wrong, reducing it a bit might improve readability.  For example, in the `bash` script:

   ```python
   "bash": """
       _pip_completion()
       {
           COMPREPLY=( $( COMP_WORDS="${COMP_WORDS[*]}" \\
                          COMP_CWORD=$COMP_CWORD \\
                          PIP_AUTO_COMPLETE=1 $1 2>/dev/null ) )
       }
       complete -o default -F _pip_completion {prog}
   """,
   ```


7. **Testing:** Consider adding unit tests to verify the generated completion scripts for each shell. While complex to fully test the integration with each shell, at least verifying the script generation itself is valuable.



By incorporating these suggestions, the `completion.py` script will become more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.
