1. **Handle `OSError` in `remove()`:** The `os.unlink()` call in the `remove()` method could raise an `OSError` if the file doesn't exist or if there are permission issues. This should be handled gracefully, perhaps by logging the error and continuing, or by raising a more specific exception if appropriate.

2. **Handle potential `OSError` in `cleanup()`:** Since `cleanup()` calls `remove()`, it also needs to handle the potential `OSError`.

3. **Handle exceptions in `add()`:** The `with open(...)` block in `add()` can also raise exceptions (e.g., `IOError`, `PermissionError`).  These should be handled.  Consider also the unlikely case where the file is deleted between the check and opening it for writing.

4. **Race condition in `add()`:** There's a potential race condition in `add()`.  Another process could create the tracker file between the `FileNotFoundError` check and the `open` for writing.  Using a lock file could prevent this, or perhaps relying on more atomic filesystem operations, if available.

5. **Clarify `LookupError` usage in `add()`:**  Using `LookupError` in `add()` might be confusing.  A more specific exception like `CycleDetectedError` (or similar) would be more informative, since the error relates to a cyclic dependency, not a standard lookup failure. This new exception should probably inherit from `ValueError` if the cycle is considered invalid input.

6. **Ensure atomicity in `track()`:**  The `track()` method isn't fully atomic. If an exception occurs within the `yield`, the `remove()` call might not be executed, leaving orphaned tracker files.  A `try...finally` block would ensure cleanup even if an exception is raised.

7. **Documentation for exceptions:** The docstrings should document the exceptions that can be raised by each method.  Specifically, the new exception mentioned in point 5 should be documented in `add()` and `track()`.

8. **Consider file locking:** For environments where multiple processes might try to access the build tracker simultaneously, consider adding file locking to `add()`, `remove()`, and `cleanup()` to prevent race conditions.

9. **Logging improvements:** The log messages could be more descriptive.  For example, in `add()`, instead of just logging that a requirement was added, log the specific key as well. This will make debugging easier. Similarly, log the exception details when exceptions are caught.

10. **Redundant assertion in `add()`:** The `assert key not in self._entries` in `add()` seems redundant.  The `LookupError` check a few lines before should already catch this case.

11. **Context manager usage in `get_build_tracker`:** It might be beneficial to log if `PIP_BUILD_TRACKER` is already set.  This would make it clear when a pre-existing build tracker is being used instead of creating a temporary one.

12. **Improve docstring in `get_build_tracker`:** The docstring for `get_build_tracker` could be expanded to explain what the context manager does and when the temporary directory will be used.  It should also note that it sets `PIP_BUILD_TRACKER`.
