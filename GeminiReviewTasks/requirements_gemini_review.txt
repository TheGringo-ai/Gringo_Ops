The proposed changes are mostly good, but have a few issues and miss some opportunities for improvement:

**Good Changes:**

* **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints significantly improves readability and maintainability.
* **Import Path Correction:** Changing the import path from `pip._vendor` to `packaging` is essential for correctness and avoids relying on internal implementation details.
* **Comment Removal:** Removing unnecessary comments is good practice.


**Issues and Further Improvements:**

1. **`SpecifierWithoutExtrasRequirement` Implementation:** The provided implementation of `SpecifierWithoutExtrasRequirement` still initializes `self._extras`. This contradicts the class's purpose of representing a requirement *without* extras. It should simply not populate the `_extras` attribute.  Or, even better, since this class inherits from `SpecifierRequirement`, consider if it's actually adding unique value. Could its functionality be achieved through a flag or argument within `SpecifierRequirement`?  If not, ensure its behavior regarding extras is truly distinct and necessary.

2. **Missing `__hash__` implementations:** For classes to be correctly usable in sets or as dictionary keys, they should implement `__hash__`.  `ExplicitRequirement`, `SpecifierRequirement`, `SpecifierWithoutExtrasRequirement`, `RequiresPythonRequirement`, and `UnsatisfiableRequirement` all need `__hash__` methods. The hash should be based on the defining attributes of each class (e.g., `self.candidate` for `ExplicitRequirement`). Example for `ExplicitRequirement`:

    ```python
    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash(self.candidate)
    ```

3. **Docstrings:** The code lacks docstrings explaining the purpose of each class and method.  Add docstrings to improve understanding and maintainability.  For example:

    ```python
    class ExplicitRequirement(Requirement):
        """Represents a requirement for a specific candidate."""

        def __init__(self, candidate: Candidate) -> None:
            """Initialize an ExplicitRequirement.

            Args:
                candidate: The specific candidate that satisfies this requirement.
            """
            self.candidate = candidate
    ```

4. **`format_for_error` in `SpecifierRequirement`:** The logic in this method could be simplified using `str.join`:

    ```python
    def format_for_error(self) -> str:
        parts = [s.strip() for s in str(self).split(",")]
        if not parts:
            return ""
        if len(parts) == 1:
            return parts[0]
        return ", ".join(parts[:-1]) + " and " + parts[-1]
    ```

5. **`UnsatisfiableRequirement` name type:** The `name` property in `UnsatisfiableRequirement` should also have the type `NormalizedName` for consistency with the other `Requirement` subclasses.

6. **Consider Liskov Substitution Principle:** Ensure that the subclasses of `Requirement` truly adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle. That is, any method on the `Requirement` base class should behave as expected when called on a subclass instance, without causing unexpected side effects or violating any implicit assumptions.  Review each method in this light.


By addressing these points, you'll enhance the code's clarity, correctness, and maintainability.
