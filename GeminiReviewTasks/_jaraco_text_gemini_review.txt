The updated code has addressed some of the original suggestions but introduced a regression and still needs a few improvements.

1. **Regression: Incorrect handling of trailing backslash:** The original logic for `join_continuation` incorrectly removed the character before the backslash.  The updated code *attempts* to fix this but now has the opposite problem; it *always* includes the character before the backslash, even when it should be removed as part of the continuation marker. The correct behavior is to remove the backslash and the *immediately preceding whitespace*, preserving any other characters.

2. **Missing type hint:**  The `yield_lines.register(str)` decorated function is missing a return type hint. It should have `-> Iterable[str]`.

3. **StopIteration handling in `join_continuation`:** The `StopIteration` handling within the `while` loop in `join_continuation` prematurely terminates the entire iteration.  If a line ends in a backslash but there are no more lines to continue with, it should simply yield the current (possibly incomplete) line instead of stopping the generator entirely.

4. **Docstring inconsistency:** The docstring example for `join_continuation` has a duplicate entry: `>>> list(join_continuation(['foo \\', 'bar', 'baz']))` appears twice.

5. **Clarity and efficiency in `yield_lines` dispatch:** The singledispatch mechanism for `yield_lines` could be simplified and made more efficient.  Instead of using `itertools.chain.from_iterable(map(yield_lines, iterable))`, which recursively calls `yield_lines` for each item in the iterable, it would be clearer and potentially faster to iterate directly through the iterable and handle strings and other iterables within a single loop.

Here's how the `join_continuation` and `yield_lines` functions could be improved:


```python
import re
from typing import Iterable, Union

def join_continuation(lines: Iterable[str]) -> Iterable[str]:
    r"""
    Join lines continued by a trailing backslash.

    >>> list(join_continuation(['foo \\', 'bar', 'baz']))
    ['foobar', 'baz']
    >>> list(join_continuation(['foo \\', 'bar \\', 'baz']))
    ['foobarbaz']
    >>> list(join_continuation(['goo\\', 'dly']))
    ['godly']

    If no line is available to continue, the partial line is yielded.

    >>> list(join_continuation(['foo', 'bar\\', 'baz\\']))
    ['foo', 'barbaz']

    Trailing whitespace before the backslash is removed.

    >>> list(join_continuation(['foo   \\', 'bar']))
    ['foobar']
    """
    lines = iter(lines)
    current_line = ""
    for item in lines:
        current_line += item
        while current_line.endswith("\\"):
            current_line = re.sub(r"\s*\\$", "", current_line)  # Remove trailing whitespace and backslash
            try:
                current_line += next(lines)
            except StopIteration:
                break  # Yield the current line even if incomplete
        yield current_line
        current_line = ""


@functools.singledispatch
def yield_lines(iterable: Union[str, Iterable[str]]) -> Iterable[str]:
    r""" ... (docstring remains the same) ..."""
    for item in iterable:
        yield from yield_lines(item)


@yield_lines.register(str)
def _(text: str) -> Iterable[str]:
    return filter(_nonblank, map(str.strip, text.splitlines()))

```

Key changes:

* **`join_continuation`:** Uses `re.sub` to correctly handle trailing backslashes and whitespace.  The `StopIteration` is handled more gracefully.
* **`yield_lines`:**  Simplified using a single loop and `yield from`.


These changes address the identified issues, improving correctness, clarity, and efficiency. Remember to also add the missing return type hint to the registered `yield_lines` function and fix the duplicate docstring example.
