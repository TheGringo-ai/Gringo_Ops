An empty `__init__.py` file is perfectly acceptable and often desirable, especially in modern Python.  It signals that the directory should be treated as a Python package.  Therefore, no changes are *required*.

However, depending on the intended structure and functionality of your package, there are several ways you can utilize `__init__.py`:

* **Import submodules or specific attributes:** This makes it easier to access frequently used parts of your package.

    ```python
    # __init__.py
    from .module1 import classA, function_x
    from .module2 import classB
    ```

* **Initialize package-level data or configurations:**  This can be helpful for setting up default values or resources.

    ```python
    # __init__.py
    DEFAULT_SETTING = "some_value"
    ```


* **Define `__all__` for controlled imports using `*`:** This specifies which modules or attributes should be imported when using `from package import *`.

    ```python
    # __init__.py
    __all__ = ["module1", "classA", "function_x"]
    ```


* **Execute initialization code upon package import:** This can be used for tasks like registering plugins or setting up logging. However,  be mindful of side effects and potential performance impacts.


    ```python
    # __init__.py
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    ```


* **Simplifying imports within the package:** Submodules can import from each other more cleanly using relative imports.  The presence of `__init__.py` establishes the package context.

    ```python
    # module1.py
    from .module2 import something  # Relative import
    ```


In summary, while an empty `__init__.py` is valid, consider these enhancements to improve the organization, usability, and maintainability of your package if they align with its purpose.  The best approach depends on the specific design of your package.
