The improvements are generally good and address the points raised in the initial prompt. Here are some further comments and minor suggestions:

* **Handling `unknown-8bit` Encoding:** The approach to handle `unknown-8bit` by trying UTF-8 and falling back to Latin-1 is reasonable.  However, it's worth noting that Latin-1 might still misrepresent the data. Consider documenting this limitation or, if possible, using a more robust fallback like `chardet` to detect the encoding.  This would require adding a dependency, though.  If Latin-1 is sufficient for the project's needs, the current solution is acceptable.

* **Type Hinting `msg.get_all` and `msg.get`:** You've used `# type: ignore` on the calls to `msg.get_all(field)` and `msg.get(field)`. This is because mypy will complain that these can potentially return `None`.  A more type-safe approach is to handle the `None` case explicitly:

```python
        if multi:
            values = msg.get_all(field)
            if values is not None:  # Explicitly handle None
                value = [sanitise_header(v) for v in values]
            else:
                value = [] # Or some other default
        else:
            value_raw = msg.get(field)
            if value_raw is not None:
                value = sanitise_header(value_raw)
                if key == "keywords":
                    # ... existing keyword handling
            else:
                value = "" # Or some other default


```


* **Docstrings:**  The docstrings are a good start.  Consider adding a brief description of the expected input format for `msg_to_json` and mentioning the keys that will be present in the output dictionary. This improves the usability of the function.  Similarly, the docstring for `sanitise_header` could be slightly more descriptive, mentioning what kind of sanitization is performed (e.g., "Decodes and converts email headers to strings, handling various encodings").

* **Keyword Handling:** The keyword handling looks correct, but it might be worth considering adding a comment to explain *why* both comma-separated and space-separated keywords are supported. This adds valuable context for future maintainers.


* **Overall Structure:** The code is well-organized and easy to follow. The use of `METADATA_FIELDS` is a good way to manage the fields and their properties.


By addressing these minor points, the code will become even more robust and maintainable.
