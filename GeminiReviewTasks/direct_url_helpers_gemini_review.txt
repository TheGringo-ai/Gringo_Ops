The updated code is a significant improvement over a hypothetical original. The suggestions for improvement were sound, and they have been implemented effectively in the provided rewrite. Here are some further minor suggestions and observations:

* **Docstrings:** While the provided docstrings are a good start, consider making them more descriptive.  For instance, in `direct_url_from_link`, mention the implications of `link_is_in_wheel_cache` and the expected behavior when `source_dir` is None. Briefly explaining *why* `source_dir` is needed in the non-wheel-cache VCS case would also be beneficial.

* **Error Handling:** While `direct_url.validate()` is called in `direct_url_as_pep440_direct_reference`, the other functions don't explicitly validate the `DirectUrl` they create.  Consider adding validation or clarifying why it's omitted.  For example, in `direct_url_from_link`, if `link.is_vcs` and `link_is_in_wheel_cache` is false, but `source_dir` is None, the code will currently raise an `AssertionError`. While technically correct according to the current logic, a more informative exception type (e.g., `ValueError`) and message would be more helpful.

* **Type Hinting `vcs_backend`:** In `direct_url_from_link`, `vcs_backend` could benefit from a type hint. While using `vcs.get_backend_for_scheme` implies a certain type, being explicit improves readability and static analysis.  You'd likely need to import the appropriate type from `pip._internal.vcs`.  Something like `from pip._internal.vcs.versioncontrol import VersionControl` and then type hint as `: VersionControl`.

* **`isinstance` vs. `hasattr`:** Using `isinstance(direct_url.info, VcsInfo)` is fine if you are sure of the class hierarchy. However, if there's a chance that subclasses of `VcsInfo`, `ArchiveInfo`, and `DirInfo` might be used in the future, switching to `hasattr(direct_url.info, 'vcs')` (and similar attributes for the other types) might be more robust, as it would work correctly even with subclasses. Consider the trade-offs based on the expected evolution of the `DirectUrl` and its `info` attribute.

* **Minor Readability:** In `direct_url_as_pep440_direct_reference`, the line  `requirement += direct_url.url` is repeated.  You could slightly refactor to avoid this repetition, perhaps by setting a `url_fragment = direct_url.url` before the `if/elif/else` block and then appending `url_fragment` to `requirement` after the block. This is a very minor point, but it could slightly improve conciseness.



These are relatively minor points; the updated code is already well-structured and incorporates the major suggested improvements effectively.  The suggestions above are primarily focused on robustness, clarity, and best practices.
