The provided improvements and updated code are generally good, but here are a few additional suggestions and comments:

* **Forward Reference for `Link` Type Hint:** While using a string literal `'Link'` for the type hint works, it might be cleaner to use a forward reference with `from __future__ import annotations` if your Python version supports it (3.7+). This avoids potential circular import issues and makes the code more readable.  If using Python 3.7+, change the first line to:
    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations
    from pip._internal.models.link import Link
    ```
    And then you can use `Link` directly in the type hint:
    ```python
    def __init__(self, name: str, version: str, link: Link) -> None:
    ```

* **Consider Immutability:** Since `InstallationCandidate` objects are used for comparison and likely represent a snapshot of a potential installation, it might be beneficial to make them immutable.  This could prevent unexpected side effects and improve code clarity. You could achieve this by converting `name`, `version`, and `link` to read-only properties after initialization.  This would require more code, so consider the trade-off between complexity and potential benefits.

* **Docstring for `InstallationCandidate`:** Add a more descriptive docstring to the class.  Explain what a "candidate" represents in the context of the larger system.  For example:

    ```python
    class InstallationCandidate(KeyBasedCompareMixin):
        """Represents a potential installation option for a package, 
        identified by its name, version, and download link.
        """
        # ... rest of the class definition
    ```

* **Redundant Import Check:** While you mentioned removing redundant imports, it's worth double-checking if `KeyBasedCompareMixin` is genuinely used. If not, remove it.

* **Version Parsing Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling for the `parse_version(version)` call.  What happens if an invalid version string is passed?  Raising a more specific exception or providing a default value might be appropriate.

* **`__str__` vs `__repr__`:** The provided `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are good. They clearly distinguish between a user-friendly string representation and a developer-focused representation.



By addressing these points, the code will be more robust, readable, and maintainable.
