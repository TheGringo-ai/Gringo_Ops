The suggested improvements are good, but the exception handling can be more specific.  Currently, it catches a generic `Exception`.  This masks potential problems and makes debugging harder.  Here's how to improve the error handling:

1. **`FileNotFoundError` for `metadata_directory`:** Although the `assert` was removed, the `metadata_directory` could still be deleted or become inaccessible between the check and the `build_wheel` call. Catching `FileNotFoundError` specifically addresses this.

2. **Backend-Specific Exceptions:** The PEP 517 backend could raise various exceptions. Consult the backend's documentation or, failing that, catch `pip._vendor.pyproject_hooks.HookExecutionError` which is a common base class for backend errors.  This allows for more informative error messages and potentially retrying or other recovery strategies.  If the backend is known (e.g., `setuptools`, `flit`), catching their specific exceptions would be even better.

3. **`subprocess.CalledProcessError` or `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` for subprocess issues:** The `runner_with_spinner_message` uses subprocesses.  If there are problems during execution, the `CalledProcessError` (with return code and output) or `TimeoutExpired` can provide valuable debugging information.

4. **Preserve original traceback:**  When re-raising or logging, include the original exception traceback to make debugging easier.  `logger.exception()` does this automatically when logging inside an `except` block.


Example incorporating these improvements:

```python
import logging
import os
import subprocess  # Import for subprocess exceptions
from typing import Optional

from pip._vendor.pyproject_hooks import BuildBackendHookCaller, HookExecutionError # Import for backend errors

# ... (rest of the code)

    try:
        # ... (existing code)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.exception("Failed building wheel for %s: metadata directory not found", name)
        return None
    except HookExecutionError as e:  # Catch backend errors
        logger.exception("Failed building wheel for %s: backend error", name)
        # Potentially examine `e.returncode`, `e.output`, etc. for details
        return None
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:  # Catch subprocess errors
        logger.exception("Failed building wheel for %s: subprocess error", name)
        logger.error("Subprocess output:\n%s", e.output) # Log the subprocess output
        logger.error("Return code: %s", e.returncode)
        return None
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as e:
        logger.exception("Failed building wheel for %s: subprocess timed out", name)
        return None    
    except Exception as e: # Catch any other unexpected errors.
        logger.exception("Failed building wheel for %s: unexpected error", name)
        return None
    return os.path.join(tempd, wheel_name)

```
By catching more specific exceptions, the code becomes more robust and provides better feedback for debugging build failures.  Remember to consult the documentation of your specific build backend for its potential exceptions.
