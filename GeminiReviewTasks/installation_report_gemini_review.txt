The suggested improvements are generally good and enhance the code's readability, robustness, and maintainability. Here's a more detailed review and some additional suggestions:

**Positives:**

* **Import Grouping:** Correctly groups imports at the top.
* **Docstrings:**  Adding docstrings significantly improves clarity.
* **Error Handling:** The added `ValueError` for missing `download_info` is crucial.
* **Type Hints:** Using type hints enhances code understanding and static analysis.
* **Future Improvement Comment:** The comment about `environment_override` is helpful for future development.


**Points for Consideration and Further Improvements:**

* **Error Handling (Specificity):**  While the `ValueError` is good, consider a more specific exception like `InstallationError` or a custom exception if appropriate. This provides more context for debugging.  The message could also be more informative, e.g.,  `f"No download_info found for requirement: {ireq.name}"`.

* **Metadata Handling:** The inclusion of `metadata` (the entire metadata dictionary) might be excessive.  Consider only including specific, relevant fields from the metadata, as the entire dictionary can be very large. This improves performance and reduces report size.

* **`requested_extras` Handling:** The conditional addition of `requested_extras` is good.  However, consider adding an empty list `[]` if `ireq.extras` is empty, maintaining a consistent data structure.

* **`is_yanked` Handling:**  The current logic assumes `ireq.link` is always present if `ireq.is_yanked` is relevant. While this is *likely* true, it might be safer to explicitly check if `ireq.link` is not None before accessing `is_yanked`,  e.g.,  `ireq.link and ireq.link.is_yanked`.  This prevents potential `AttributeError` exceptions.

* **Environment Marker Evaluation (Regarding the TODO):**  The TODO comment is good. When implementing the `environment_override`,  provide a mechanism to evaluate markers against this overridden environment.  This will enable more accurate reporting when installation is performed with a specific environment context.

* **Testing:**  No mention is made of tests.  Adding unit tests for the `InstallationReport` class is essential to ensure its correctness and prevent regressions.  Test cases should cover scenarios like missing `download_info`, various types of requirements (editable, direct, etc.), and different extras.

* **Consider a dataclass:** Using a `dataclass` for the return dictionary from `_install_req_to_dict` and even for the overall report structure could simplify the code and improve readability.



**Example incorporating some of the suggestions:**

```python
# ... (imports)

class InstallationError(ValueError):  # More specific exception
    pass


# ... (InstallationReport class)

    @classmethod
    def _install_req_to_dict(cls, ireq: InstallRequirement) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # ... (existing code)
        if not ireq.download_info:
            raise InstallationError(f"No download_info found for requirement: {ireq.name}")  # More informative message

        res["metadata"] = {  # Select specific metadata fields
            "name": ireq.get_dist().metadata.get_all("Name")[0],
            "version": ireq.get_dist().metadata.get_all("Version")[0],
            # Add other relevant fields as needed
        }
        
        res["requested_extras"] = sorted(ireq.extras) if ireq.extras else [] # Consistent structure

        res["is_yanked"] = ireq.link and ireq.link.is_yanked  # Safer access


# ... (rest of the code)
```

By addressing these points, the `installation_report.py` code will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand. Remember to add comprehensive tests!
