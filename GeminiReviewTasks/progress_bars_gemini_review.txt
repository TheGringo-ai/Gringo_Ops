The suggested improvements are generally good, but here are some further refinements and considerations:

**1. Type Hinting `size`:**  While the suggestion adds type hints, `size` should be `Optional[int]`  because it can be `None` as per the original code and the updated `get_download_progress_renderer` signature.

**2. Error Handling for `size is None`:**  The current "improvement" uses `float("inf")`. This works, but it's less clear than explicitly checking for `None`. Consider a more readable approach:

```python
    if size is None:
        # ... indeterminate progress setup ...
    else:
        total = size
        # ... determinate progress setup ...
```

**3. `List` vs. `Tuple` for `columns`:** The suggestion to use `List` is debatable. While it *allows* modification, the code doesn't actually *need* to modify the columns after creation.  `Tuple` is generally preferred for fixed collections as it signals immutability, which can improve code clarity and prevent unintended modifications.  Unless there's a specific reason to modify `columns` later, stick with `Tuple`.

**4. Docstrings:** The added docstrings are good, but could be more descriptive.  For example, in `_rich_progress_bar`, explain what `bar_type` is used for (currently it only checks if it's "on").  The docstring for `get_download_progress_renderer` should explain what happens when `bar_type` is not "on" (it returns the `iter` function - a no-op renderer).

**5. Refactoring `_rich_progress_bar`:** While the current implementation isn't terribly complex, you could slightly improve readability by separating the creation of the `Progress` object and the iteration logic.  This might make the code easier to understand and maintain, especially if more complex logic is added later.  For example:

```python
def _rich_progress_bar(...):
    """..."""
    progress = _create_progress_object(size) # Helper function
    task_id = progress.add_task(...)

    with progress:
        for chunk in iterable:
           # ...
```

**6. Consider `tqdm` if appropriate:**  Rich is great, but if your primary goal is simple progress bars for downloads, `tqdm` might be a lighter-weight dependency.

**7.  Indentation in the Task Description:**  The code includes ` " " * (get_indentation() + 2)` for the task description.  Make sure this indentation handling interacts correctly with other logging and output in your application. It might be worth clarifying the purpose and desired behavior of this indentation in the docstring.

**8.  `refresh_per_second`:**  The current value is 30. Consider if this is the optimal refresh rate.  Higher values can increase CPU usage, while lower values might make the progress bar feel less responsive.

By addressing these points, you'll further enhance the code's clarity, robustness, and maintainability.
