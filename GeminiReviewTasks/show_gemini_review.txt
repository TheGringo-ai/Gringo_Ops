The listed changes to `show.py` represent good improvements focusing on consistency, readability, and robustness. Here are some further comments and suggestions for potential improvements based on the provided description:

* **Consider using a `try...except` block instead of a None check for `dist.editable_project_location`:** While checking for `None` works, a `try...except` block targeting the specific attribute error (likely `AttributeError`) would be more robust and handle other potential issues related to accessing that attribute.  This is generally preferred for handling potential attribute errors, as it's more explicit about what error you anticipate.

* **Clarify the sorting criteria:**  Simply stating "predictable output order" isn't very informative.  Specify *what* the sorting is based on. For example, is it alphabetical sorting based on the package name?  This detail is essential for understanding the change and its implications.

* **Unit tests:**  The improvements are a good opportunity to add or update unit tests to verify the changes, especially for the exception handling and sorting. This ensures the changes work as expected and prevents regressions.

* **Documentation:** If `show.py` has a docstring or related documentation, ensure it reflects the implemented changes regarding type hints, sorting, and error handling.

* **Context on `dist.canonical_name` vs. `dist.raw_name`:** Briefly explain *why* `dist.canonical_name` is preferred over `dist.raw_name` for consistency. What inconsistencies were being observed before?  This helps anyone reviewing the code understand the motivation behind the change.

* **Consider a linter:**  A linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) could automatically enforce many style and type hint conventions, improving consistency and potentially catching other issues.

* **Type hints for internal variables:** While the description mentions type hints for function arguments and return types, consider adding type hints for internal variables within the functions as well, especially complex data structures, for improved readability and static analysis.


By incorporating these suggestions, the changes to `show.py` will be even more robust, maintainable, and understandable.
