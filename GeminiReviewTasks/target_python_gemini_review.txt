The updated code looks good and addresses the requested improvements regarding type hints. Here are a few minor suggestions and observations:

1. **`type: ignore` Comment:** The `# type: ignore` comment on the `get_supported` call is necessary because `pip._vendor.packaging.tags.get_supported` doesn't have type hints defined in that specific vendored version.  If a newer version of the `packaging` library *does* have type hints, consider updating the vendored library to remove the need for the ignore comment.  If updating is not feasible, the comment is fine as is and explains the situation.

2. **Docstring for `get_unsorted_tags`:**  The phrase "Exactly the same as get_sorted_tags, but returns a set" could be slightly improved.  Perhaps: "Returns the same set of supported PEP 425 tags as `get_sorted_tags`, but as an unordered set. This is important for performance when checking for membership."  This clarifies the benefit of using a set.

3. **Caching Logic:** The caching using `self._valid_tags` and `self._valid_tags_set` is well implemented.  It correctly handles the case where the user provides no version information, using the special `versions=None` logic in `get_supported`.

4. **Testing:** While the code changes are straightforward, testing is crucial.  Ensure you have tests that cover the following scenarios:
    * Providing all possible combinations of `platforms`, `py_version_info`, `abis`, and `implementation` (including `None`).
    * Verify that the returned tags are correct in each case.
    * Confirm that the caching mechanism is working as expected.

5. **Consider `cached_property` (Python 3.8+):**  If you're using Python 3.8 or later, consider using `@cached_property` instead of manual caching.  This would simplify the code and make it more concise:

   ```python
   from functools import cached_property  # Python 3.8+

   # ...

   @cached_property
   def get_sorted_tags(self) -> List[Tag]:
       # ... (same logic as before, without the caching variables)

   @cached_property
   def get_unsorted_tags(self) -> Set[Tag]:
       return set(self.get_sorted_tags())
   ```

These are relatively minor points. Overall, the updated code with the type hints is a definite improvement. Just make sure to test thoroughly.
