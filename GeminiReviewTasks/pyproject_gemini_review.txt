The provided information describes improvements to a `load_pyproject_toml` function, but only shows the updated function signature with type hints.  We need the original code to give specific feedback.  However, based on the described changes, here are some general comments and potential further improvements:

* **Missing Return Type Hints for `Optional` Case:** While the return type is indicated as `Optional[Tuple[...]]`, the code snippet doesn't show what is returned when it *is* `None`.  Clarity is crucial.  Explicitly return `None` in the code where appropriate and document the conditions under which this happens.  A good docstring explaining when the function returns `None` is highly recommended.

* **Context for Simplification:**  The description mentions simplifying PEP 517 logic.  Without the original code, it's impossible to assess the effectiveness of this simplification.  Over-simplification can lead to bugs.  Provide the before-and-after code for a proper review.

* **Reason for Assertion Removal:**  The description states that an unnecessary assertion was removed.  Knowing *why* it was unnecessary is essential. Was it redundant with other checks?  Did it cover a case that can't occur?  Explain the rationale behind the removal to prevent reintroducing it or missing a potential edge case.

* **Handling of `use_pep517`, `setup_py`, and `req_name`:**  The function signature includes `use_pep517`, `setup_py`, and `req_name`. The provided information doesn't tell us *how* these parameters are used. It's crucial to understand their roles and whether the type hints accurately reflect their usage.  Consider adding docstrings that describe these parameters, their purpose, and how they influence the function's behavior.

* **Clarity on Return Values:** The return type is a tuple: `Tuple[List[str], str, List[str], List[str]]`.  What does each element of this tuple represent?  Without this context, the type hints are less helpful.  Use descriptive names for tuple elements or unpack them into named variables for better readability, or, at the very least, document each part of the returned tuple in the docstring.

* **Error Handling:** What happens if the `pyproject.toml` file is invalid, missing, or cannot be parsed?  The code should handle these scenarios gracefully, perhaps by raising informative exceptions or returning `None` (with appropriate documentation).

* **Consider a dataclass for return:**  Instead of returning a complex tuple, creating a dataclass to hold the return values could significantly improve readability and maintainability.  This would give meaningful names to the different parts of the result.


In summary, while adding type hints is a positive step, providing more context and details about the changes and their motivations is crucial for a thorough review.  Show the original code, explain the reasoning behind each change, and clarify the roles of all parameters and return values.  A complete docstring would also be highly beneficial.
