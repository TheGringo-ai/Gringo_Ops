The suggested improvements are good overall, enhancing readability and adding clarity. However, there's a more Pythonic and efficient way to implement the `is_archive_file` function, and one minor suggestion could be improved:

1. **Simplified `is_archive_file`:**  The entire `if/return True/return False` block can be replaced with a single, more concise return statement:

   ```python
   def is_archive_file(name: str) -> bool:
       """Return True if `name` is considered as an archive file.

       Args:
           name (str): The file name.

       Returns:
           bool: True if the file is considered an archive, False otherwise.
       """
       return splitext(name)[1].lower() in ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS
   ```

2. **More specific comment for `splitext`:** Instead of just saying "Extracts file extension from the path," be a little more precise.  Mention that it returns a tuple:

   ```python
   from pip._internal.utils.misc import splitext  # splitext: Returns a (filename, extension) tuple.
   ```


The suggestion to split the `if` condition onto a single line isn't necessary. The original code's formatting is already perfectly readable and the proposed change doesn't improve it meaningfully. Similarly, while using the `in` operator with `ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS` directly is correct, the intermediate `ext` variable in the original "before" code wasn't problematic in terms of performance or readability.  Therefore, focusing on the simplified return statement and slightly improved comment offers the most impactful enhancements.
