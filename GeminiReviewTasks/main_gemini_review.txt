The redundancy in the "Improvements made" section is the most glaring issue.  All four points describe the same change: adding an `import runpy`.  This should be consolidated to a single point.

More importantly, the file focuses heavily on importing `runpy` without any indication of *why* it's needed.  The "Tasks" section highlights this lack of purpose.  A key improvement would be to demonstrate the *usage* of `runpy`. If it's not actually used, the import should be removed entirely.  Simply importing a module doesn't achieve anything.

The comments also don't explain *what* the intended functionality is.  Adding comments that describe the overall goal of the `main.py` file would significantly improve its readability and maintainability.

In short, the main suggested improvements are:

* **Remove redundant comments:** Consolidate the four identical "Improvements made" entries into one.
* **Justify the import:** Either demonstrate the usage of `runpy` within the code or remove the import entirely.
* **Explain the purpose:**  Add comments to explain what `main.py` is supposed to do.  This context is crucial for understanding the code.
* **Remove unnecessary "Tasks":**  Once the code is clarified, the "Tasks" will likely become self-evident or irrelevant.  They shouldn't be necessary in well-commented, functional code.


Addressing these points would lead to a much cleaner and understandable `main.py` file.
