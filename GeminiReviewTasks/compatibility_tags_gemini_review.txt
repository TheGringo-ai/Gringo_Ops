The provided description lacks the actual code of `compatibility_tags.py`.  I can only offer general advice without seeing the code itself.  However, based on the description, here are some potential areas for improvement and comments to consider when reviewing the code:

* **Clarity and Documentation:**
    * **Docstrings:** Ensure the `get_supported` function and all helper functions have clear and comprehensive docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions they might raise.  Include examples if applicable.
    * **Comments:** Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or non-obvious choices.  Avoid over-commenting trivial code.
    * **Variable names:** Use descriptive variable names to improve readability.
    * **Function length:** If the `get_supported` function or any of its helpers are very long, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable functions.

* **Error Handling:**
    * **Input Validation:**  `get_supported` should validate its input arguments. For instance, check for invalid version formats, unknown platforms, or unsupported implementations. Raise appropriate exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) for invalid inputs.
    * **Handling edge cases:** Carefully consider and document how the function handles edge cases or unusual combinations of version, platform, implementation, and ABIs.

* **Efficiency:**
    * **Avoid redundant computations:**  If certain calculations or checks are performed repeatedly, consider caching or pre-computing the results to improve performance.
    * **Data structures:**  Choose appropriate data structures (e.g., sets, dictionaries) to optimize lookups and comparisons, particularly if the number of supported tags or platforms is large.

* **Maintainability:**
    * **Modularity:**  Organize the code into logical modules or classes if appropriate.  This improves reusability and makes it easier to add or modify support for new platforms or ABIs in the future.
    * **Testing:**  Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the `get_supported` function and its helpers, especially for edge cases and different platform/ABI combinations.

* **Specific to Compatibility Tags:**
    * **Consistency:** Adhere to established conventions and standards for compatibility tags.  Ensure consistency in tag naming and formatting.
    * **Completeness:** Verify that the code handles all relevant compatibility tags for each supported platform and ABI.  Keep the list of supported tags up-to-date.
    * **Extensibility:** Design the code so that it can be easily extended to support new compatibility tags or platforms in the future.


Without the code, these are general recommendations. A code review with the actual `compatibility_tags.py` file would provide more concrete and specific feedback.
