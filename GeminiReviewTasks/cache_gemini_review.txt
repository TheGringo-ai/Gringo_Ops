The revised `cache.py` code has several improvements but still needs some adjustments:

1. **Inconsistent Return Types:** The `get` method is correctly annotated to return `Optional[bytes]`.  However, `get_body` returns a `BinaryIO` or `None`.  For consistency with the `BaseCache` interface and general Python practices, `get_body` should also return `Optional[bytes]`. You should read the file within the `get_body` function and return the bytes.  The current implementation leaks file handles if the caller doesn't explicitly close the file.

2. **Unnecessary `expires` Parameter:** The `set` method includes an `expires` parameter, but it's unused.  Either remove the parameter entirely or implement expiration logic if required.  Note that `BaseCache.set()` does *not* take an `expires` parameter; the modified code *should not* take one either, since this breaks the interface. The related `FileCache` also does not implement expiry directly.

3. **Overly Broad Exception Handling:**  While catching `FileNotFoundError` is good, using a bare `except OSError` in `suppressed_cache_errors` is too broad. It could mask unexpected errors that should be addressed, hindering debugging. Narrow down the exception handling to specific expected exceptions like `PermissionError` or `OSError` with specific errno values if possible.  In most cases, it might be acceptable to allow other exceptions to be raised rather than suppressing potentially important problems.

4. **Redundant `FileNotFoundError` Check in `get()`:** You check for file existence before opening the file and then catch `FileNotFoundError`. The second check is redundant. Remove the `try...except FileNotFoundError` block. The outer check is sufficient.

5. **Consider using `io.BytesIO` for `get()` when returning bytes:** If you are working with in-memory byte streams, using `io.BytesIO` to wrap the bytes read from the file can provide better compatibility with other parts of the code that expect a file-like object.

Here's a summary of the recommended changes:

* **`get_body()`:** Change return type to `Optional[bytes]`, read the file content, and return the bytes. Ensure proper error handling and file closing within the method.
* **`set()`:** Remove the unused `expires` parameter.
* **`suppressed_cache_errors()`:**  Refine the exception handling to catch specific expected exceptions or consider removing it altogether.  Document the rationale for any suppressed errors.
* **`get()`:** Remove redundant `FileNotFoundError` check. Consider using `io.BytesIO` to wrap the bytes returned.

Addressing these points will further improve the `cache.py` module's robustness, maintainability, and adherence to expected interface contracts.
