The provided improved code already incorporates all the suggested changes:

1. **Type hints for return types:** All functions now have return type hints (`-> Optional[str]`).
2. **Type hint for `sites`:**  The `sites` variable is correctly typed as `List[str]`.
3. **Typo correction:** The typo `egglink` has been corrected to `egg_link` throughout.
4. **Type hint for `egg_link` in loop:** Inside the loops, `egg_link` is correctly annotated as `str`.
5. **Type hint for `egg_link_name` in loop:**  `egg_link_name` is implicitly typed as `str` due to the iteration over `egg_link_names: List[str]`. An explicit type hint is not strictly necessary but could be added for clarity as `egg_link_name: str`.
6. **Docstrings:**  All functions now have docstrings explaining their purpose.
7. **Refactoring `egg_link_path_from_sys_path`:**  The function is already reasonably readable.  The nested loop is clear in its intent. While more complex refactoring could be considered depending on desired coding style (e.g., using a generator expression or `any` with a nested generator for a more functional approach), the current implementation is sufficiently clear.  Further refactoring wouldn't necessarily improve readability significantly.

The only potential minor improvement is the addition of optional explicit type hints in the loops as mentioned in point 5. Otherwise, the code effectively addresses all the initial suggestions and is well-structured.
