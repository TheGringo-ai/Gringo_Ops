The provided code has several positive aspects, like type hints and clear variable names. However, there's room for improvement:

1. **`__hash__` Implementation:** The implementation of the `__hash__` method is complex and potentially inefficient.  It creates a long string by iterating through the hashes.  Consider using a simpler approach, like hashing a tuple of sorted items from `self._allowed_hashes`.  This will be more performant and readable.  For example:

   ```python
   def __hash__(self) -> int:
       return hash(tuple(sorted(self._allowed_hashes.items())))
   ```

   However, even this isn't strictly correct if you intend to use `Hashes` as a key in a dictionary.  A better approach may be to make the class immutable and then calculate the hash only once during initialization.

2. **Immutability:**  The `Hashes` class should ideally be immutable. Currently, its internal state (`_allowed_hashes`) can be modified after initialization, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, especially when used as dictionary keys. Consider making `_allowed_hashes` a read-only property and initializing it in the constructor.  The `__and__` method should then return a *new* `Hashes` object instead of modifying an existing one.

3. **Error Handling in `__init__`:** The `__init__` method could perform some input validation. It currently accepts any iterable as values in the `hashes` dictionary, but it later assumes these are strings.  Consider adding a check and raising a `TypeError` if the input is not a dictionary of string: list of strings.

4. **Efficiency of `__and__`:** The list comprehension within the `__and__` method could be slightly more efficient using set intersection:

   ```python
   new_hashes = {}
   for algorithm, values in other._allowed_hashes.items():
       if algorithm in self._allowed_hashes:
           new_hashes[algorithm] = sorted(list(set(values) & set(self._allowed_hashes[algorithm])))
   ```

5. **Clarity of `__bool__`:** While the current implementation works, it might be clearer to directly check the length:

   ```python
   def __bool__(self) -> bool:
       return bool(len(self._allowed_hashes))
   ```

6. **Docstring for `__and__`:**  The docstring for the `__and__` operator is missing. It should describe what the intersection of two `Hashes` objects represents.

7. **Type hint for `_raise`:** The `_raise` method has a type hint for `computed_hashes` as `Dict[str, "_Hash"]`. While `_Hash` might work, it's not a standard type and might be confusing. It's likely referring to `hashlib._Hash`, which is a private class.  Consider using a more general type hint, such as `hashlib.HASH` (if available) or `Any`. Or simply remove the type hint for this internal method since `hashlib.new()` returns `hashlib._Hash`.



By addressing these points, the code can become more robust, efficient, and easier to understand and maintain.
