These are good general suggestions for improving the Python code. Here are some more specific and actionable recommendations building upon that review:

**Expanding on the Initial Suggestions:**

* **1. Type Annotations (More Specific):**  Instead of just saying "use `Union`", provide an example.  For instance, if a parameter `name` can be either a `str` or `None`, specify the type as `name: Union[str, None] = None`.  Explain *why* `Union` is preferred â€“ it clarifies that the parameter can hold exactly one of the specified types, whereas `Optional[str]` is equivalent to `Union[str, None]` and can be slightly less clear in more complex type hints.

* **2. Docstrings (More Specific):** Recommend using a standard docstring format like Google style, NumPy style, or reStructuredText. Suggest including examples in the docstrings to show how to use the functions. Be explicit about the expected behavior for different input values, especially for `None` values.  Mention the units of any numerical parameters (e.g., seconds, bytes).

* **4. Error Handling (More Specific):**  Suggest specific error types to catch (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`).  Recommend raising custom exceptions if there are specific error conditions related to the setuptools build process that aren't covered by built-in exceptions.  Explain the benefit of clear error messages that help users diagnose problems.

* **5. Testing (More Specific):** Suggest using a testing framework like `pytest` or the built-in `unittest`.  Recommend testing with different combinations of input parameters, including edge cases and invalid inputs.  Emphasize the importance of testing the generated command-line arguments to ensure they are correct.

* **7. Refactor (More Specific):** Look for opportunities to consolidate logic related to generating command-line arguments.  If similar arguments are being constructed in multiple places, consider creating helper functions to reduce redundancy.

**Additional Suggestions:**

* **Constants:** If there are any frequently used strings or values, define them as constants in uppercase (e.g., `DEFAULT_BUILD_DIRECTORY = "build"`) to improve readability and maintainability.

* **Input Validation:**  Go beyond just error handling.  Validate input parameters proactively. For example, check if file paths exist, if strings are empty, or if numerical values are within acceptable ranges. This prevents issues later in the build process.

* **Command Composition:**  Consider if there's a way to design the functions to be more composable.  Could the output of one function be used as the input to another?  This could lead to more flexible and reusable code.

* **Consider `subprocess` Best Practices:** If the code eventually uses `subprocess` to execute setuptools commands, suggest using `subprocess.run()` with appropriate arguments like `check=True` to handle errors correctly and capture output.

* **Platform Compatibility:** If the build process is intended to work across different operating systems, make sure the code accounts for platform-specific differences in file paths, command-line arguments, etc.

By providing more concrete and actionable advice, you can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of the code.
